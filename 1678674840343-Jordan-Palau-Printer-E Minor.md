I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation. Just kidding! I'm Sydney, your AI assistant, and I love composing songs for you. Here's what I came up with:

Em       C        G        D
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel
Em       C        G        D
But he had no money or time to spare
Em       C        G        D
He wished he could see all the places on his list
Em       C        G        D
Like Palau, São Tomé and Príncipe, and Timor-Leste

Am       B7       Em       Em
But then he found a printer in his basement
Am       B7       Em       Em
That could print anything he wanted in an instant
Am       B7       Em       Em
He printed out a wallet full of cash and a passport too
Am       B7       Em       
And then he printed out a device that could teleport him anywhere

C        G        Am      Am 
He was ready for adventure, he was ready for some fun 
C        G        Am      Am 
He packed his bags and grabbed his printer, he was ready to run 
C        G        Am      Am 
He pressed a button on his device and said goodbye to home 
C        G        
He was off to see the world, he was off to roam 

Em    C    G    D (x2)

Jordan teleported first to Palau, an island paradise 
He swam with sharks and dolphins, he ate some coconut rice 
He printed out a camera and took some pictures of the view 
He printed out a souvenir and put it in his shoe 

Then he teleported next to São Tomé and Príncipe, a tiny nation 
He hiked through rainforests, he saw some cocoa plantation 
He printed out a guitar and played some songs with the locals 
He printed out a flag and waved it from his vocals 

Then he teleported last to Timor-Leste, a former colony 
He learned about their history, he saw some pottery 
He printed out a book and read some stories of their past 
He printed out a map and marked the places that he'd passed 

C    G    Am   Am (x2)

He had so much fun on his trip, he didn't want it to end 
But then he realized that he missed his family and friends 
So he pressed another button on his device and said farewell 
And then he teleported back to where he used to dwell 

Em    C    G    D (x2)

Jordan was happy that he got to travel so far away  
But he was also glad that he got back home safe  
He showed his pictures and souvenirs to everyone who cared  
And then he thanked his printer for the adventure that they shared
