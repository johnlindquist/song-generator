Sure, I can try to write a song about a watering can and post-it notes in the style of They Might be Giants. Here is what I came up with:

```markdown
Em       C        G        D
I found a watering can in my garage
Em       C        G        D
It was dusty and rusty and full of holes
Em       C        G        D
I wondered who left it there and why
Em       C        G        D
Maybe it was a gift from a long-lost friend

C         G          D          Em
But then I saw a post-it note stuck on the side
C         G          D          Em
It had a message written in a familiar hand
C         G          D          Em
It said "I'm sorry for what I did to you"
C         G          D          Em
"I hope you can forgive me someday"

G         C           D           Em 
This is the story of the watering can and the post-it note 
G         C           D           Em 
They were part of a plan that went horribly wrong 
G         C           D           Em 
They were meant to be a symbol of love and care 
G         C           D           Em 
But they ended up being a reminder of pain and despair 

Em       C        G        D
I remembered how we used to garden together 
Em       C        G        D
We planted flowers and vegetables and herbs 
Em       C        G        D
We watered them with the watering can every day 
Em       C        G        D
We wrote notes to each other on post-it notes 

C         G          D          Em
But then you cheated on me with someone else 
C         G          D          Em
You broke my heart and shattered my trust 
C         G          D          Em
You left me without saying goodbye 
C         G          D          Em
You only left me this watering can and this post-it note 

G         C           D           Em  
This is the story of the watering can and the post-it note  
G         C           D           Em  
They were part of a plan that went horribly wrong  
G         C           D           Em  
They were meant to be a symbol of love and care  
G         C           D           Em  
But they ended up being a reminder of pain and despair  

Em       Am      B7      Bm7-5    (x2)
Now I don't know what to do with them 
Should I keep them or throw them away? 
Should I forgive you or forget you? 
Should I move on or stay? 

Am      B7      Bm7-5    E7   
Maybe I'll use them for something else   
Am      B7      Bm7-5    E7   
Maybe I'll make them into art   
Am      B7      Bm7-5    E7   
Maybe I'll give them to someone new   
Am      B7      Bm7-5    E7   
Maybe I'll just let them go   

A     E     F#m     A     (x2)
This is not the end of the story    
This is just another chapter    
This is not the end of me    
This is just another factor    

A     E     F#m     A     
This is not goodbye    
This is hello    
This is not why    
This is how    

A     E     F#m     A     
The watering can and the post-it note    
They might be giants    
They might be rain, they might be heat    
They might be frying up a stalk of wheat    

A     E     F#m     A     
The watering can and the post-it note    
They might be giants    
They might be dust, they might be rust    
They might be part of us
