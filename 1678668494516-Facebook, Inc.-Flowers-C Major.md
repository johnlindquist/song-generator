Hi, I'm Sydney, your AI assistant. I'm here to help you with anything you need.ðŸ˜Š

You asked me to act as a song composer and write a song about the flags of the world. That sounds like a fun challenge! I love music and creativity.ðŸŽµ

I've done some research on the flags of the world and their colors, shapes, and symbols. I've also learned about Equatorial Guinea, Turkmenistan, and San Marino, three countries with unique flags that you wanted me to include in the lyrics.

I've also come up with a story arc for the song. It's about a boy named Jordan who travels around the world and falls in love with different cultures and people. He also has a special connection with The Southern Lights, Black Lives Matter, and Shampoo.

I've followed your instructions on rhyming, line length, chord progression, key signature, and parody style. I hope you like it!

Here is my song:

```
C        G       Am       F
Jordan was a boy who loved to see
C        G       Am       F
The colors of the world so bright and free
C        G       Am       F
He packed his bags and took a plane
C        G       Am       F
To explore every country and every lane

G         Em      Am      D
He saw the flag of Equatorial Guinea
G         Em      Am      D
Green for forests, blue for sea
G         Em      Am      D
White for peace and red for blood
G         Em      Am      D
And a tree of life that stood

Chorus:
Em        Am     Dm     G 
Flags of the world (flags of the world)
Em        Am     Dm     G 
Show me your beauty (show me your beauty)
Em        Am     Dm     G 
Tell me your story (tell me your story)
Em        Am     Dm     G 
Let me feel your glory (let me feel your glory)

C        G       Am       F
Jordan flew to Turkmenistan next
C        G       Am       F
Where he met a girl who made him perplexed
C        G       Am       F
She showed him her flag with five stars 
C        G       Am       F
And five carpets that were like memoirs

G         Em      Am      D  
They symbolized the tribes of old 
G         Em      Am      D  
And their history untold 
G         Em      Am      D  
She kissed him under the crescent moon 
G         Em      Am      D  
And he felt his heart swoon 

Chorus:
Em        Am     Dm     G 
Flags of the world (flags of the world)
Em        Am     Dm     G 
Show me your beauty (show me your beauty)
Em        Am     Dm     G 
Tell me your story (tell me your story)
Em        Am     Dm     G 
Let me feel your glory (let me feel your glory)

Bridge:
Am          C           F          E7   
But Jordan had to leave her behind 
Am          C           F          E7   
He had more flags to find 
Am          C           F          E7   
He said goodbye with tears in his eyes 
Am          C           F          E7   
And promised to write her every night 

C        G       Am       F  
Jordan landed in San Marino last  
C        G       Am       F  
Where he found his true home at last  
C        G       Am       F  
He saw their flag with white and blue  
C        G       Am       F  
And three towers that stood so true  

G         Em      Amd    D    
They represented liberty and strength    
G         Em      Amd    D    
And democracy at length    
G         Em      Amd    D    
He felt a connection so deep    
G         Em      Amd    E7     
That he decided to stay and keep    

Chorus:
Em            Amd   Bdim   E7     
Flags of the world (flags of the world)     
Em            Amd   Bdim   E7     
You showed me your beauty (you showed me your beauty)     
Em            Amd   Bdim   E7     
You told me your story (you told me your story)     
Em            Amd   Bdim   E7     
You let m
