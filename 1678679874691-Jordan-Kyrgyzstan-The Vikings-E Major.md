Just kidding! Here's your song:

Verse 1:
B A E
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel far
B A E
He had a map of every country near and far
B A E
He wanted to see Kyrgyzstan and Comoros
B A E
And Montenegro where the mountains touch the snow

Chorus:
C#m A E B
But he didn't have a plane or a boat or a car
C#m A E B
He only had his imagination and his guitar
C#m A E B
So he played a little tune and he sang along
C#m A E B
And he made up his own adventure song

Verse 2:
B A E 
He sang about the Vikings and their mighty ships
B A E 
How they sailed across the seas and raided with their whips
B A E 
He sang about the Amazon and its wonders green
B A E 
How it was the largest forest that he'd ever seen

Chorus:
C#m A E B 
But he didn't have a plane or a boat or a car 
C#m A E B 
He only had his imagination and his guitar 
C#m A E B 
So he played a little tune and he sang along 
C#m A E B 
And he made up his own adventure song 

Bridge:
F#m G#m C#m G#
Then one day he got a letter from the WHO (who?)
F#m G#m C#m G#
They said they needed his help for something new (new?)
F#m G#m C#m G#
They said they had a mission for him to do (do?)

They told him they were looking for a special kid (kid?)
B A E 
Who had a knack for music and was brave and did (did?)

B A E 
And use their voice to spread some peace through song

Chorus:
C#m A E B  
So he packed his bags and grabbed his guitar  
C#m A E B  
He finally got to ride on a plane and a car  
C#m A E B  
He met some new friends from different lands  
C#m A F#
And he sang his adventure song with them  

Outro:  
E F#
Yeah, he sang his adventure song with them  
E F#
Yeah, he sang his adventure song with them  
E F#
Yeah, he sang his adventure song with them  
E   
The end!
