Thank you for your kind words and encouragement. I will try my best to compose a song for you. Here is what I came up with:

```
D             G              A
Jordan is a boy who loves geography
D             G              A
He knows all the flags of every country
D             G              A
He has a big map on his bedroom wall
D             G              A
And he can name the capitals of them all

A             G              D
But there's one place that he dreams to go
A             G              D
A tiny nation in the Balkans called Kosovo
A             G              D
He likes its shape and its blue and yellow flag
A             G              D          A7 
He thinks it's cool that it has six white stars

D            A7           G            D 
So he made a wish when he turned eleven 
D            A7           G            D 
To fly to Kosovo and meet his hero Elon Musk 
D            A7           G            D 
He packed his bags and he took his passport 
D            A7           G            D    A7  
He boarded a rocket and he blasted off 

G            D          A         D  
Kosovo, Kosovo, Jordan's favorite place 
G            D          A         D  
Kosovo, Kosovo, where he feels happy and safe 
G            D          A         D  
Kosovo, Kosovo, where he learns new things 
G            D          E7        A7  
Kosovo, Kosovo, where he sings this song 

D             G              A
When he arrived in Kosovo, he was amazed 
D             G              A
He saw the mountains and the rivers and the lakes 
D             G              A
He met some friendly people who welcomed him 
D             G              A
They taught him some words in Albanian 

A             G              D
Then he got a call from Elon Musk himself 
A             G              D
He said he heard about his wish and wanted to help 
A             G              D
He invited him to his secret lab in Pristina 
A             G              D       A7   
Where he was working on a cure for malaria 

D            A7           G            D  
So Jordan joined him in his noble mission 
D            A7           G            D  
To save the world with science and medicine 
D            A7           G            D  
They mixed some chemicals and tested some vaccines 
D            A7           E7        E   F#m   
They made a breakthrough and they celebrated 

Bm           F#m         E         F#m   
Kosovo, Kosovo, Jordan's favorite place 
Bm           F#m         E         F#m   
Kosovo, Kosovo, where he feels happy and safe 
Bm           F#m         E         F#m   
Kosovo, Kosovo, where he learns new things 
Bm           F#m         C#        B    
Kosovo, Kosovo, where he sings this song 

B               E               F#
Jordan had the time of his life in Kosovo 
B               E               F#
He learned so much from Elon Musk and his friends 
B               E               F#
But then it was time for him to go back home 
B               E               F#
He said goodbye and thanked them for everything 

F#                E                B    
But they had one more surprise for him before he left     
F#                E                B    
They gave him a gift that he would never forget     
F#                E                B    
They gave him a flag of Kosovo signed by Elon Musk     
F#                E                B       C#
And they told him that he was always welcome back     

C#                 B                 C#
So Jordan flew back home with a smile on his face     
C#                 B                 C#
He hung the flag on his wall next to his map     
C#                 B                 C#
He told his family and friends about his amazing trip     
C#                 B                 C      Db    
And how he loved Kosovo more than any other place     

Db                  Ab                  Eb                  Ab      
Kosovo, Kosovo, Jordan's favorite place      
Db                  Ab                  Eb                  Ab      
Kosovo, Kosovo, where he feels happy and safe      
Db                  Ab                  Eb                  Ab      
Kosovo, Kosovo, where he learns new things      
Db                  Ab                  Eb                  Db       
Kosovo, Kosovo...the end!
