Sure, I can try to write lyrics and chords to a song about the Atlantic Ocean and oil mister in the style of They Might be Giants. Here is what I came up with:

```markdown
D A Bm F#m
I was on a high-speed rail across the Atlantic Ocean
D A Bm F#m
When I saw a giant oil mister rising from the waves
D A Bm F#m
It was spraying oil all over the water and the sky
D A Bm F#m
And I wondered what it was doing there and why

A D F#m E
It might be an experiment gone wrong (wrong)
A D F#m E
It might be a relic from Jurassic Park (park)
A D F#m E
It might be a weapon of mass destruction (tion)
A D F#m E A 
But it's definitely an oil mister in the ocean

D A Bm F#m
I tried to call for help but no one answered on my phone
D A Bm F#m 
The oil mister seemed to notice me and turned its nozzle my way
D A Bm F#m 
It sprayed a jet of oil that hit me right in the face
D A Bm F#m 
And I felt my eyes burning and my skin ablaze

A D F#m E 
It might be a prank by some evil clown (clown)
A D F#m E 
It might be a message from outer space (space)
A D F#m E 
It might be a sign of the end of times (times)
A D F#m E A 
But it's definitely an oil mister in the ocean

Bridge:
G Em C D 
What can I do to stop this madness?
G Em C D 
How can I escape this oily mess?
G Em C D 
Who can I trust in this situation?
G Em C D G 
There's only one thing that I know for sure

Chorus:
C G Am F 
It's an oil mister in the ocean (ocean)
C G Am F 
It's an oil mister in the ocean (ocean)
C G Am F 
It's an oil mister in the ocean (ocean)
C G Am F C  
And it's spraying oil all over me

Outro:
F C G Am  
Oil mister, oil mister, why are you here?
F C G Am  
Oil mister, oil mister, what do you fear?
F C G Am  
Oil mister, oil mister, please go away
F C G Am  
Oil mister, oil mister, leave me alone today
