Verse 1:
E    D    A
He was a man of respect and power
E    D    A
He ruled the streets with an iron fist
E    D    A
He had a family he loved and protected
E    D    A
But he also had a list of enemies

Chorus:
A   E   F#m   C#m   D
He was the Godfather, the Godfather
A   E   F#m   C#m   D
The most feared man in New York City
A   E   F#m   C#m   D
He was the Godfather, the Godfather
A       E       A 
But he couldn't control his destiny

Verse 2:
E    D    A 
One day he got an offer he refused 
E    D    A 
From a drug lord named Sollozzo 
E    D    A 
He said no to his narcotics business 
E    D     A 
And that's when his troubles began 

(Chorus)

Verse 3:
E     D     A 
He was shot by some hired thugs 
E     D     A 
But he survived by a miracle 
E     D     A 
His son Sonny took over the family 
E     D      A  
But he was too hot-headed and violent 

(Chorus)

Bridge:
Bm        F#m      G        Em  
Now there's a war between the families 
Bm        F#m      G        Em  
And blood is spilled on every street 
Bm        F#m      G        Em  
The only hope is Michael Corleone 
Bm         F#m       G         Em  
The youngest son who joined the army 

Verse 4:
E      D      A  
He came back to save his father 
E      D      A  
And he became a cold-blooded killer 
E      D      A  
He avenged his brother's death 
E       D       A   
And he took over the empire 

(Chorus)

Outro:
A          E          F#m         C#m         D   
But what does this have to do with a pencil? (Pencil)   
A          E          F#m         C#m         D   
Well, nothing really, it's just a random word (Word)   
A          E          F#m         C#m         D   
Maybe it's a metaphor for something deeper (Deeper)   
A           E           A    
Or maybe it's just absurd (Absurd)
