Okay, I will try to write a song about a scissors holder and a spatula in the style of They Might Be Giants. Please note that this is a parody and not meant to be taken seriously. Here is my attempt:

```markdown
Bm        A       G
Scissors holder was lonely
Bm        A       G
He had no one to hold
Bm        A       G
He searched the kitchen drawers
Bm        A       G
But found no love at all

D         A       G      D
Then he saw her on the counter
D         A       G      D
She was shiny and so flat
D         A       G      D
She was a spatula with a smiley face
D         A       G      D 
And he felt his heart go splat

G         D       A      G 
They might be lovers (boy)
G         D       A      G 
They might be lovers 
G         D       A      G 
They might be weird, they might be wrong 
G         D       A      G 
They might be singing this song 

Scissors holder and spatula (boy)
Scissors holder and spatula 
They don't care what others say 
They're happy in their own way 

Bm        A       G      
Scissors holder was happy 
Bm        A       G      
He had someone to hold 
Bm        A       G      
He snipped her hair and made her laugh 
Bm        A       G      
He felt so brave and bold 

D         A       G      D       
But then he saw him on the table 
D         A       G      D       
He was wooden and so tall 
D         A       G      D       
He was a chair with a cannabis leaf 
D         A       G      D        
And he made his lover fall 

G         D       A      G  
They might be cheaters (boy)  
G         D       A      G  
They might be cheaters  
G         D       A      G  
They might be high, they might be low  
G         D       A      G  
They might be breaking up oh no  

Spatula and chair (boy)  
Spatula and chair  
They don't care about scissors holder's pain  
They're living in their own lane  

Bm        F#7     Bm     F#7   
Scissors holder was angry   
Bm        F#7     Bm     F#7   
He had no one to hold   
Bm        F#7     Bm     F#7   
He grabbed the chair and threw him out   
Bm        F#7     Bm     F#7   
He felt so cold and old   

E          B          Ab    E    
But then he saw her on the floor    
E          B          Ab    E    
She was broken and so sad    
E          B          Ab    E    
She was a spatula with a sorry face    
E          B          Ab    E     
And he felt his heart go bad    

Ab        E          B     Ab     
They might be sorry (boy)     
Ab        E          B     Ab     
They might be sorry     
Ab        E          B     Ab     
They might be late, they might be lost     
Ab        E          B     Ab     
They might be paying the cost     

Scissors holder and spatula (boy)     
Scissors holder and spatula     
They don't care what others think     
They're happy in their own sink
