Here is a song I wrote for you:

Verse 1:
Gm   Eb   Bb   F
There's a formula that tells us
Gm   Eb   Bb   F
How many aliens are out there
Gm   Eb   Bb   F
It's called the Drake equation
Gm   Eb   Bb   F
But it's really just a guess

Chorus:
Gm    D    Eb    Bb    Cm    D    Gm
We don't know how many factors are involved
Gm    D    Eb    Bb    Cm    D    Gm
We don't know how many planets have evolved
Gm    D    Eb    Bb    Cm    D    
We don't know how many civilizations rise and fall

Verse 2:
Gm   Eb   Bb   F
There's another thing that puzzles us
Gm   Eb   Bb   F
It's the faint glow of the sky
Gm   Eb   Bb   F
It's called the cosmic microwave background radiation 
Gm   Eb  Bb  F 
But we don't know why

Chorus:
Gm     D     Eb     Bb     Cm     D     Gm 
We don't know what caused this ancient light to shine 
Gm     D     Eb     Bb     Cm     D     Gm 
We don't know what happened at the dawn of time 
Gm     D     Eb     Bb      Cm      D     
We don't know if there's a message hidden in its design 

Bridge:
C       G       Am       Em       F       G       C  
Maybe there's a connection between these mysteries 
C       G       Am       Em       F       G       C  
Maybe there's a clue that we have missed 
C        G        Am        Em        F         G         C  
Maybe there's a wormhole or a portal or a gateway 
C        G        Am        Em        F         G         C  
Maybe there's something else that we can't list 

Verse 3:
Gm      Eb      Bb      F  
Like the event horizon of a black hole 
Gm      Eb      Bb      F  
Or the loch ness monster in Scotland 
Gm      Eb      Bb      F  
They might be giants or they might be small 
Gm      Eb      Bb      F  
They might be real or they might be not 

Chorus: (x2)
