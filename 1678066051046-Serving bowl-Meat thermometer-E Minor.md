Em       C        G        D
I was just a serving bowl in a fancy restaurant
Em       C        G        D
You were a meat thermometer that they used to check the don
Em       C        G        D
We met one night when they served roast beef with mashed potatoes
Em       C        G        D
You stuck your probe into my side and I felt a sudden glow

G       D       Em      C
You said you liked my curves and my ceramic glaze
G       D       Em      C
I said you had a nice display and a piercing gaze
G       D       Em      C
We decided to run away before they washed us clean
G       D       Em      C 
We jumped into a garbage truck and headed for the scene

Am      Bm      C     D 
We're serving bowl and meat thermometer 
Am      Bm      C     D 
We don't care what people say 
Am      Bm      C     D 
We're serving bowl and meat thermometer

We're living life our own way 

Em       C        G        D
We found a cozy dumpster near an alleyway downtown 
Em       C        G        D
We made ourselves a little nest with some coat hangers we found 
Em       C        G        D
We watched the stars at night and listened to the city sounds 
Em       C        G        D
We didn't need much else to make us happy and profound 

G       D       Em      C  
But then one day we heard some news that made us feel dismayed 
G       D       Em      C  
The 2016 presidential election was underway 
G       D       Em      C  
And one of the candidates had plans to make us pay 
G       D       Em      C  
He wanted to ban all kitchenware that wasn't made in USA
