Okay, I'll try my best to compose a song for you. I hope you like it. Here it is:

```markdown
Am    D    G    C
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel
Am    D    G    C
He had a map and a magic gavel
Am    D    G    C
He could go anywhere he wanted to go
Am    D   G   C
Just by hitting the map and saying so

G     D     Em     C     D     C
But one day he made a big mistake
G     D     Em     C     D     C
He hit the map too hard and it started to shake
G     D      Em      C      D      C 
It tore apart and scattered all over the place
G       D        Em       C       D       C 
And Jordan found himself in a very strange space

G        Em         Am         D  
He was in Afghanistan, but not for long
G        Em         Am         D  
He saw some soldiers and they sang this song

(Chorus)
C           G          Am          F          G          F 
We are the army of Afghanistan, we fight for freedom and our land 
C           G          Am          F          G          F 
We don't like invaders or terrorists, we just want peace and happiness 
C           G          Am          F          G          F 
But we have a problem that we can't solve, we need some water from the Dead Sea salt 
C           G          Am          F          G         F  
So we need your help, little boy, you have to find the Dead Sea for us 

Jordan was confused but he agreed to help
He hit his gavel on a nearby kelp
He said "Dead Sea" and hoped for the best
But he ended up in Nauru, not impressed

He was in Nauru, but not for long
He saw some refugees and they sang this song

(Chorus)
We are the refugees of Nauru, we fled from war and persecution 
We don't like detention or abuse, we just want freedom and protection 
But we have a problem that we can't solve, we need some food from Sao Tome's grove 
So we need your help, little boy, you have to find Sao Tome for us 

Jordan was scared but he agreed to help
He hit his gavel on a nearby shell
He said "Sao Tome" and hoped for the best
But he ended up in Jaws (film), very stressed

He was in Jaws (film), but not for long
He saw some sharks and they sang this song

(Chorus)
We are the sharks of Jaws (film), we love to eat people and swim 
We don't like harpoons or cages, we just want blood and carnage 
But we have a problem that we can't solve, we need some magic from wizards' towers 
So we need your help, little boy, you have to find wizards' towers for us 

Jordan was terrified but he agreed to help (why?)
He hit his gavel on a nearby belt (why?)
He said "wizards' towers" and hoped for the best (why?)
But he ended up back home with no rest (oh)

(Bridge)
Em            Bm             Am             Bm  
Jordan realized that he had been tricked by his map 
Em            Bm             Am             Bm  
It was all a prank by his older brother Jack 
Em            Bm             Am             Bm  
Jack had glued some pieces of different maps together 
Em            Bm             Am             Bm  
And made Jordan go on an adventure that would last forever 

(Final chorus)
C           G              Am              F              G              F   
Jordan was angry at his brother Jack, he wanted to get him back somehow   
C           G              Am              F              G              F   
He grabbed his gavel and his map again, he had an idea that would make him grin   
C           G              Am              F              G              F   
He hit them both with all his might  ,and said "Jack's room" with delight   
C           G               Am               F               G               F    
And then he saw Jack's face turn pale ,as Jordan sent him on an epic fail   

The end!
