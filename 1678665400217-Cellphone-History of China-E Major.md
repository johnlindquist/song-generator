# Flags of the World

Verse 1:
E            A           B          A
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel in time
E            A           B          A
He had a machine that he built with his mind
E            A           B          A
He wanted to see all the flags of the world
E            A           B          A
And learn about their colors, shapes, and symbols

Chorus:
E            A           B          A
Flags of the world, flags of the world
E            A           B          A
They tell us stories of nations and cultures
E            A           B          A
Flags of the world, flags of the world
E            A           B          E 
Let's explore them together, Jordan and me

Verse 2:
E            A           B          A 
He set his machine to go back in history 
E            A           B          A 
To see how the flags were created and changed 
E            A           B          A 
He saw the flag of Suriname with its green, white, red, and star 
E            A           B          E 
He learned that it represents hope, peace, justice, and diversity 

(Chorus)

Verse 3:
E            A           B          E 
He traveled to Vanuatu in the Pacific Ocean 
E            A           B          E 
He saw their flag with its yellow, black, red, and green  
E            A           B          E  
He learned that it symbolizes their land, people, blood, and nature  
A             F#m        G#m        C#m  
But he also found something else that caught his eye 

Bridge:
A             F#m        G#m        C#m  
It was an enchanted object that looked like a shell  
A             F#m        G#m        C#m  
It had a mysterious power that he could feel  
A             F#m        G#m        C#m  
He picked it up and put it in his pocket  
A             F#m        G#m        C#m   
But he didn't know what it would do next  

Verse 4:
B              C         D         C   
He went to Azerbaijan in Central Asia   
B              C         D         C   
He saw their flag with its blue, red, green, and crescent   
B              C         D         C    
He learned that it stands for their sky, fire, land, and faith    
B              C         D         G    
But he also felt something strange happening inside him  

(Chorus)

Outro:
G             D         E         D    
The enchanted object started to glow   
G             D         E         D     
It activated his machine without his control   
G             D         E         D     
It took him to a place he didn't know   
G             D         E         
It was The CERN in Switzerland   

G             D         
Where they study particle physics   
C             Am        
And try to unlock the secrets of the universe   
G             D         
But they also have a hidden agenda   
C             Am        
They want to use Jordan's machine for their own purpose   

G             
What will happen next?   
D             
Will Jordan escape?   
C             
Will he see more flags?   
Am            
Will he find his way back?   

G             
To be continued...
