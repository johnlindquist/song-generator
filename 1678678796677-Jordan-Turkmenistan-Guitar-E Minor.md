Here is the song I composed for you. I hope you like it!

# Turkmenistan

Em       C        G        D
Jordan was just a boy of eleven
Em       C        G        D
He had a dream to go to heaven
Em       C        G        D
But he didn't want to die or pray
Em       C        G        D
He wanted to fly there in a plane

G       D      Em      C     G     D     C
So he saved up all his money from his paper route
G       D      Em      C     G     D     C
And he bought a ticket to a place he'd never heard about

(Chorus)
Em      D      C      G    Em    G    C 
Turkmenistan, Turkmenistan, he's going to Turkmenistan
Em      D      C      G    Em    G    C 
Turkmenistan, Turkmenistan, he's flying to Turkmenistan

Em       C        G        D
He boarded the plane with his guitar
Em       C        G        D
He hoped to be a rock and roll star
Em       C        G        D
He didn't know what awaited him there
Em       C        G        D 
He just wanted to breathe some fresh air

G       D      Em      C     G     D     C 
But when he landed in Ashgabat, he got a shock 
G       D      Em      C     G     D     C 
The airport was full of soldiers and they put him in a lock

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
Am         Bm         Am         Bm  
They took him to a prison where they showed him a film 
Am         Bm         Am         Bm  
It was A Clockwork Orange and it made him feel ill 
Am         Bm         Am         Bm  
They tried to brainwash him with violence and sex 
Am         Bm         Am         Bm  
But he resisted with his music and his intellect 

(Solo)
Em  -  -  -  |C  -  -  -  |G  -  -  - |D  -  -   -
| x4

(Verse)
Em       C        G        D   
He played his guitar for the guards 
Em       C        G        D   
He sang them songs about love and stars 
Em       C        G        D   
He made them laugh and cry and dance 
Em       C        G        D   
He won their hearts with his charm and glance 

G       D      Em      C     G     D     C  
They decided to let him go and gave him a gift 
G       D      Em      C     G     D     C  
It was a ticket to another island that was more swift 

(Chorus)
Palau, Palau, he's going to Palau 
Palau, Palau, he's flying to Palau 

(Outro)
C          Am          F          E7    
But when he got there he met someone who changed his life 
C          Am          F          E7    
It was none other than The Rock, aka. Mr. Johnson or Mr. Strife. He said:

F           E7           F           E7    
Hey kid, I like your style and your attitude 
F           E7           F           E7    
How would you like to join me in my movie crew? 

C          Am          F          E7    
Jordan couldn't believe his ears or his eyes 
C          Am          F          E7    
He said yes without hesitation or disguise 

F           E7           F           E7    
And so they flew away together in The Rock's jet plane 
F           E7           F           E7    
To Hollywood where Jordan became famous and insane 

C   Am   F   E7 (fade out)   
Turkmenistan...Palau...Hollywood...
