Gregor Mendel was a monk who studied peas
D             A              G              D
He discovered genes and how they make us who we are
D             A              G              D
But he never knew that his work would lead to AI
D             A              G              D
Artificial intelligence in media and entertainment

G             A               Bm            A
Now we have machines that can write songs and stories
G             A               Bm            A
They can mimic human voices, emotions, and styles
G             A               Bm            A
They can learn from data and create new content
G             A               Bm            A (hold)
They can even fool us with their deepfake smiles

D             G              Bm             A 
This is the age of artificial creativity 
D             G              Bm             A 
Where algorithms rule the music and the screen 
D             G              Bm             A 
But do they have a soul or a sense of originality? 
D (hold)       G (hold)       Bm (hold)     A (hold)
Or are they just repeating what they've seen?

Em            F#m            G              Em  
Gregor Mendel would be amazed if he could see this now 
Em            F#m            G              Em  
How his experiments with plants have changed the world somehow 
Em            F#m            G              Em  
But he might also wonder if we've gone too far somehow 
Em (hold)     F#m (hold)     G (hold)      Em (hold)
If we've lost our human touch in our quest for wow
