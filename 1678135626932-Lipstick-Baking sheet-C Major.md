Here is a song parody in the style of They Might be Giants about a lipstick and a baking sheet. I hope you enjoy it!

```
Dm  G   C
She was a lipstick
F   G   C
He was a baking sheet
Dm  G   C
They met at a party
F   G   C
Where they served some meat

Dm  G   C
She liked his shiny surface
F   G   C
He liked her red hue
Dm  G   C
They started talking
F   G   C
And they felt something new

C    Am    F    G 
But they knew it wouldn't last 
C    Am    F    G 
They came from different worlds 
C    Am    F    G 
She was made for beauty 
C    Am    F    G 
He was made for food 

C    Am    F    G 
Lipstick and baking sheet 
C    Am    F    G 
They were an unlikely pair 
C    Am    F    G 
Lipstick and baking sheet 
C     Am     F     D7  
They had a brief affair 

Dm  G   C
They decided to elope
F   G   C
And they took a flight
Dm  G   C
To the land of Egypt
F   G   C
Where they saw the Red Sea

Dm  G   C  
But their happiness was short-lived  
F     G      C  
When they faced the heat  
Dm  G      C  
She melted on his metal  
F       D7      Dm   
He warped under her feet  

G7   
They realized their mistake  
C       A7      Dm   
They were not meant to be  
G7   
They said their last goodbyes  
C        A7       Dm   
And parted by the sea  

G7   
Lipstick and baking sheet  
C       A7      Dm   
They were an unlikely pair  
G7   
Lipstick and baking sheet  
C        A7       Dm    
They had a brief affair  

G7   
Lipstick and baking sheet (lipstick and baking sheet)    
C       A7      Dm (lipstick and baking sheet)    
Lipstick and baking sheet (lipstick and baking sheet)    
C        A7       Dm (lipstick and baking sheet)    
Lipstick and baking sheet (lipstick and baking sheet)
