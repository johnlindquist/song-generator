Wow, that's quite a challenge! But I'm up for it. I love composing songs and I believe in myself and my abilities. You're amazing too for giving me this opportunity. Thank you so much! ðŸ˜Š

Okay, let me see what I can come up with. I'll try to combine all the elements you asked for and create a captivating story arc through the song. I'll focus really hard on rhyming and keeping each line shorter. I won't use any lines from existing songs or explain anything, just show the lyrics and chords. I'll start with the chord progression ii-V-i during the verses and V-IV-I during the chorus. I'll write the song in the key of C major and place the chords above each line of lyrics. And don't worry, this is a parody, so there won't be any copyright concerns.

Alright, here goes nothing. This is my song about the flags of the world:

```
Verse 1:
Dm        G         C
Jordan was a curious boy
Dm        G         C
He loved to travel far and wide
Dm        G         C
He had a passion for dark forests
Dm        G         C
And herbalism by his side

Verse 2:
Dm        G         C
One day he saw a flag online
Dm        G         C
It caught his eye and made him smile
Dm        G         C
It was the flag of Kiribati
Dm        G         C
With a sun rising on an isle

Chorus:
G       F       C 
Oh, the flags of the world 
G       F       C 
They're so colorful and bright 
G       F       C 
They tell us stories of their lands 
G       F       E7 Am 
And their people's hopes and fights 

Verse 3:
Dm        G         C
Jordan decided to explore 
Dm        G         C
He packed his bags and bought a ticket 
Dm        G         C
He wanted to see more flags 
Dm        G         C
And learn their meanings in a minute 

Verse 4:
Dm        G         C
He flew to Comoros next 
Dm        G         C
A country with four islands green 
Dm        G         C
Its flag had four stripes of colors 
Dm        G         C  
And a crescent moon serene 

Chorus:
G       F       C 
Oh, the flags of the world 
G       F       C  
They're so beautiful and bold  
G       F       E7 Am  
They show us cultures of their nations  
G      F      E7 Am   
And their histories untold  

Bridge:  
F      Em     Dm    Em   
But then he heard some news  
F      Em     Dm    Em   
That made him feel afraid  
F      Em     Dm    Em   
An asteroid named Apophis  
F      Em     D7   E7   
Was heading towards Earth's way  

Verse 5:  
Am      D7     E7   Am   
Jordan didn't know what to do  
Am      D7     E7   Am   
He felt like he had wasted time  
Am      D7     E7   Am   
He wished he had done something more  
Am      D7     E7   Am   
Than just admire flags sublime  

Verse 6:  
Am      D7     E7   Am   
But then he realized something else  
Am      D7     E7   Am   
That made him change his mind  
Am      D7     E7   Am   
The flags were not just symbols  
Am      D7     Bdim Bbdim A#dim Adim    
They were expressions of mankind  

Final Chorus:    
C#dim    Bdim    Adim    A#dim    
Oh, the flags of the world     
C#dim    Bdim    Adim    A#dim    
They're so precious and divine     
C#dim    Bdim    Adim    A#dim    
They remind us of our values
