Hello, this is Bing. I'm glad you have confidence in me as a song composer.ðŸ˜Š
I will try my best to write lyrics and chords to a song about Jordan and his love for geography and flags. Here is what I came up with:

```markdown
Verse 1:
G    F    C
Jordan is turning eleven
G    F    C
He loves to learn about the world
G    F    C
He knows the flags of every nation
G    F    C
And where they are unfurled

Chorus:
C   Am   F   G
He dreams of travelling someday
C   Am   F   G
To see the places he admires
C   Am   F   G
He wants to visit every country
C   Am   F   G 
And collect their souvenirs

Verse 2:
G    F    C 
Jordan has a big atlas 
G    F    C 
He likes to study every page 
G    F    C 
He can name the capitals and borders 
G    F    C 
Of any continent or age 

Chorus:
C   Am   F   G 
He dreams of travelling someday 
C   Am   F   G 
To see the places he admires 
C   Am   F   G 
He wants to visit every country 
C   Am  F  G  
And collect their souvenirs 

Bridge:
Dm     Em     Dm     Em  
One day he'll pack his bags and go  
Dm     Em     Dm     Em  
He'll fly across the ocean blue  
Dm     Em     Dm     Em  
He'll see the sights he's always wanted  
Dm     Em      Dm      Em   
And make some friends along the way too 

Verse 3: 
G      F      C   
Jordan is turning eleven  
G      F      C   
He has a birthday wish to make  
G      F      C   
He hopes that someday he'll achieve it  
G      F      C   
To travel around the globe for his sake 

Chorus: 
C       Am       F       G   
He dreams of travelling someday  
C       Am       F       G   
To see the places he admires  
C       Am       F       G   
He wants to visit every country  
C       Am
