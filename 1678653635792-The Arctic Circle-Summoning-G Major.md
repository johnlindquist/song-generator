Thank you for your kind words and your detailed instructions. I will try my best to compose a song for you. Here is what I came up with:

```
G       Em      C       D
Jordan is turning eleven today
G       Em      C       D
He loves geography and flags all the way
G       Em      C       D
He has a big wish to travel the world
G       Em      C       D
And see all the places that he's learned

C        G        Am        F
So he packs his bags and hops on a plane
C        G        Am        F
He's heading to Oman, that's his first destination
C        G        Am        F
He wants to see the mountains and the desert sand
C        G        Am        F 
And learn about the culture and history of the land

G         Em          C         D 
This is Jordan's birthday adventure (oh yeah)
G         Em          C         D 
He's flying high with his flag collection (oh yeah)
G         Em          C         D 
He's going to Oman, he's so excited (oh yeah)
G         Em          C         D 
He loves the flag with its red, white and green (oh yeah)

G       Em      C       D
Jordan arrives in Muscat, the capital city
G       Em      C       D 
He sees the Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque so pretty
G       Em      C       D 
He learns that Oman is an ancient nation
G       Em      C       D 
With a rich heritage and a diverse population

C        G        Am        F 
He visits the souq and buys some souvenirs
C        G        Am        F 
He tries some dates and halwa, they're sweet and delicious
C        G        Am        F 
He meets some friendly locals who teach him some words
C        G        Am        F 
They show him how to wave the flag with pride and joy

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
Em           Bm           C            G  
Jordan has so much fun in Oman, he doesn't want to leave
Em           Bm           C            G  
But he knows there are more countries to see and explore
Em           Bm           C            G  
So he says goodbye to his new friends and thanks them for their kindness
Em           Bm           C            G  
And he boards another plane with his flag in his hand

(Chorus x2)

(Outro)
G             Em              C             D   
Happy birthday Jordan, you're such a lucky boy (oh yeah)
G             Em              C             D   
You've seen Oman, but there's more to enjoy (oh yeah)
