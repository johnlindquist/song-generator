Gm    D    Eb   F
Homer was bored one day
Gm    D    Eb   F
He wanted to get away
Gm    D    Eb   F
He packed his bags and left his home
Gm    D    Eb   F
To find a place where he could roam

Cm    Eb   F    G
He flew across the ocean blue
Cm    Eb   F    G
He landed on a mountain view
Cm    Eb   F    G
He saw a sign that said "Beware"
Cm    Eb   F  G  G7 
Of the Yeti living there

Chorus:
Gm  Cm  F  D7 
Oh Yeti, Yeti, Yeti 
Gm  Cm  F  D7 
You're so hairy and so scary 
Gm  Cm  F  D7 
But Homer wants to be your friend 
Gm  Cm  F     D7     Gm  
Will you let him in the end?

Gm    D     Eb   F  
Homer climbed up the hill 
Gm     D      Eb   F  
He had some time to kill 
Gm      D      Eb       F  
He stumbled upon a cave so dark 
Gm       D        Eb       F  
He heard a roar that made him bark 

Cm     Eb      F      G  
He saw a pair of glowing eyes 
Cm     Eb      F      G  
He felt a surge of fear and surprise 
Cm     Eb        F        G  
But then he noticed something strange 
Cm     Eb       F       G     G7   
The Yeti had a yellow mane 

Chorus:
Oh Yeti, Yeti, Yeti 
You're so hairy and so scary 
But Homer wants to be your friend 
Will you let him in the end?

Bridge:
Eb         Bb         C         C7   
The Yeti was lonely and misunderstood 
Eb         Bb          C          C7   
He only wanted someone who could 
F          Bb          C          Am   
Appreciate his love for donuts and beer 
F          Bb           C           Am   
And listen to his stories of Titan's frontier 

Chorus:
Oh Yeti, Yeti, Yeti 
You're so hairy and so scary 
But Homer wants to be your friend 
Will you let him in the end?

Outro:
Gm        D        Eb       F  
They became buddies for life 
Gm        D        Eb       F  
They shared their joys and strife 
Gm        D        Eb       F  
They sang this song with all their might 
Gn        D        Ebb      Fn     
Oh Yeti, Yeti, good night!
