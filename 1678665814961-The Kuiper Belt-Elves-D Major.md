Here is the song I composed for you about the flags of the world and how they relate to Jordan and his adventures with The Eiffel Tower, The Vikings, and Lamp shade. I hope you like it!

D             Bm            G              A
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel around the world
D             Bm            G              A
He had a passion for flags and all their colors unfurled
D             Bm            G              A
He wanted to see them all, from big to small, from old to new
D             Bm            G              A
He packed his bags and grabbed his lamp shade, he had a lot to do

G           A           D          Bm
He started with Tuvalu, a tiny island nation
G           A           D          Bm
He admired their flag of blue with stars in formation
G           A           D          Bm
He met a girl named Lani who showed him how to dance
G           A           D          Bm 
They fell in love under the moonlight, he thought he found romance

D         A        Bm       G       D         A        Bm       G 
But then he saw Oman, with its red, white and green flag 
D         A        Bm       G       D         A        Bm       G 
It had two swords and a dagger, it looked so cool and rad 
D         A        Bm       G       D         A        Bm       G 
He left Tuvalu without saying goodbye, he broke Lani's heart 
D         A        Bm       G       D         A        Em      Asus4  -  A  
He flew to Oman to see the flag, he didn't know he tore her world apart 

Chorus:
    D     Em     F#m    G     Asus4 -  A  
Oh Jordan, why do you chase the flags? 
    D     Em     F#m    G     Asus4 -  A  
Don't you know they're just pieces of cloth? 
    D     Em     F#m    G     Asus4 -  A  
You're missing out on life and love 
    D     Em     F#m    G      Asus4 -  Asus2 -  Asus4 -  Asus2   
You're hurting people with your wanderlust 

D             Bm            G              A
