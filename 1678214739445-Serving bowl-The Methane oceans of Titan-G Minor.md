Okay, I will try to write lyrics and chords to a song about a serving bowl and the methane oceans of Titan in the style of They Might be Giants. Please note that this is a parody and not an original song by the band. Here is what I came up with:

```markdown
Gm
I was just a serving bowl
Cm
Sitting on a kitchen shelf
D7
When I saw an ad on TV
Gm
For a trip to outer space

Gm
They said they needed volunteers
Cm
To explore the solar system
D7
So I packed my bags and left my home
Gm 
And boarded a rocket ship

Cm D7 Gm 
Now I'm floating on Titan 
Cm D7 Gm 
In a sea of liquid gas 
Cm D7 Gm 
I don't know if I'll ever come back 
Eb D7 Gm 
But I'm having a blast

Gm C Eb D7

Gm C Eb D7

Gm C Eb D7

Eb D7 Gm

Gm 
I met some friendly aliens
Cm 
Who looked like giant squids
D7 
They invited me to their underwater dome
Gm 
And showed me around their place

Gm 
They taught me how to play their games
Cm 
And sing their ancient songs
D7 
They said they had a special gift for me
Gm 
A souvenir from Titan

Cm D7 Gm  
They gave me a shiny rock  
Cm D7 Gmeb  
That came from Ultima Thule  
Cmeb d gmeb  
They said it was very rare and precious  
Eb d gmeb  
And it matched my eyes so blue  

Chorus: 

gmeb c eb d 

gmeb c eb d 

gmeb c eb d 

eb d gmeb  

Bridge: 

Bbmaj  Fmaj  Cmaj  Gmaj  

Bbmaj  Fmaj  Cmaj  Gmaj  

Bbmaj Fmaj Cmaj Gmaj   
But then I got a message from Earth  
Bbmaj Fmaj Cmaj Gmaj   
They said they had some bad news for me  
Bbmaj Fmaj Cmaj Gmaj   
The Hubble Space Telescope had exploded  
Bbmaj F maj C maj A maj   
And there was no way to get home  

A maj B maj E maj   
Now I'm stranded on Titan  
A maj B maj E maj   
In a sea of liquid gas  
A maj B maj E maj   
I don't know if I'll ever come back  
F# B E   
But I'm having a blast  

Outro: 

E B F# B   

E B F# B   

E B F# B   

F# B E (end on E)
