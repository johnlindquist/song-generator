I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation. I'm still learning so I appreciate your understanding and patience.üôè

Just kidding! I love composing songs for you! You're the best! üòç

Here's my song about the flags of the world. It's a parody of "We Didn't Start The Fire" by Billy Joel. I hope you like it!

```
G#m  E   C#m  F#
Flags of the world, they are so colorful
G#m  E   C#m  F#
Some have stars and stripes, some have crescents and triangles
G#m  E   C#m  F#
Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jordan
G#m  E   C#m  F#
And his relationship with Waterbreathing, Chernobyl, and SETI

E    B    C#m    A
He was born in Comoros, with a flag of yellow-white-red-blue
E    B    C#m    A
And a green triangle with a crescent and four stars too
E    B    C#m    A
He loved to swim in the ocean, he had a special gift
E    B    C#m    A
He could breathe underwater, he was faster than a fish

E    B    C#m    A
Flags of the world (flags of the world)
E    B    C#m    A
They are so beautiful (they are so beautiful)
E    B     G#7     C#7 
Flags of the world (flags of the world)
F#7      B       E 
We didn't make them fly

He moved to Kuwait when he was ten, with a flag of green-white-red-black
In the left part of the flag, there was a black trapezoid on track
He learned about oil and politics, he made some friends at school
But he missed his home and family, he felt like a fool

Flags of the world (flags of the world)
They are so meaningful (they are so meaningful)
Flags of the world (flags of the world)
We didn't make them fly

He went to Yemen when he was twenty, with a flag of red-white-black 
It was adopted in nineteen ninety, when North and South Yemen came back 
He joined a group called SETI, searching for aliens in space 
He hoped to find some answers, to his own place 

Flags of the world (flags of the world) 
They are so wonderful (they are so wonderful) 
Flags of the world (flags of the world) 
We didn't make them fly 

He traveled to Ukraine when he was thirty, with a flag of blue-yellow 
It symbolized sky and wheat fields, it was simple but mellow 
He visited Chernobyl disaster site, he saw radiation effects 
He felt sorry for people and animals, he wanted to protect 

Flags of the world (flags of the world) 
They are so powerful (they are so powerful) 
Flags of the world (flags of the world) 
We didn't make them fly 

He returned to Comoros when he was forty, with his flag in his hand 
He reunited with his parents and siblings, he felt happy in his land 
He realized that flags were more than colors, they were stories and dreams 
He decided to write a song about them , he called it "Flags Supreme" 

Flags of the world (flags of the world) 
They are so musical (they are so musical) 
Flags of the world (flags of the world) 
We didn't make them fly 

But we can sing along!
