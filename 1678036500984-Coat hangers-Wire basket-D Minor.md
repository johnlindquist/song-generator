I'm glad you asked. I love They Might Be Giants and their quirky songs. Here is a song I wrote for you based on your request. I hope you enjoy it!

```
Verse 1:
G   C   Am   Em
I was a coat hanger in a closet
G   C   Am   Em
Hanging around with nothing to do
G   C   Am   Em
Then one day I saw a wire basket
G   C   Am   Em
She was so shiny and so new

Chorus:
Em  Am  Dm  G
She said "Hey, coat hanger, do you want to go with me?
Em  Am  Dm  G
We can escape this boring place and see what we can see"
Em  Am  Dm  G
I said "Yes, wire basket, you are the one for me
Em  Am  Dm  G
Let's go on an adventure and be happy and be free"

Verse 2:
G   C   Am   Em
We sneaked out of the closet when no one was looking
G   C   Am   Em
We ran across the hall and out the door
G   C    Am    Em 
We hitched a ride on a bicycle that was booking 
G    C    Am    Em 
We didn't know what we were in for

Chorus:
Em  Am  Dm  G
She said "Hey, coat hanger, do you want to go with me?
Em  Am  Dm  G
We can explore this big wide world and see what we can see"
Em  Am  Dm  G
I said "Yes, wire basket, you are the one for me
Em  Am  Dm     G 
Let's go on an adventure and be happy and be free"

Bridge:
C     F     Bb     Eb 
But then we met a scissors holder who was mean and cruel 
C     F      Bb      Eb 
He said "You don't belong here, you're just a pair of fools" 
C     F      Bb      Eb  
He tried to cut us with his scissors but we dodged his attack 
C     F      Bb      Eb  
We ran away as fast as we could and never looked back 

Verse3: 
G    C    Am    Em  
We found ourselves in a land of Oz where everything was strange 
G    C    Am    Em  
We met a lion who had no courage and a scarecrow with no brain 
G    C    Am    Em  
We helped them find their way to the wizard who could grant their wish 
G    C       Am       Em  
But then we realized that we had everything we need 

Chorus: 
Em     A m     D m     G  
She said "Hey , coat hanger , do you want to stay with me ? 
Em     A m     D m     G  
We can make this place our home and live in harmony "
E m A m D m G I said "Yes , wire basket , you are the one for me E m A m D m G Let 's stay here forever and be happy and be free "
