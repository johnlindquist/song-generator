Here is a song I wrote about a Clock and Calculator in the style of They Might be Giants. It is a parody, so don't take it too seriously. Enjoy!

Verse 1:
Bm7  E7   Am
Clock was feeling lonely
Bm7  E7   Am
He had no one to talk to
Bm7  E7   Am
He wished he had a friend who
Bm7  E7   Am
Could understand his point of view

Verse 2:
Bm7  E7   Am
Calculator was bored with math
Bm7  E7   Am
He wanted to do something new
Bm7  E7   Am
He dreamed of having fun and laughs
Bm7  E7   Am
With someone who shared his IQ

Chorus:
Am    G     F 
Then one day they met each other 
Am    G     F 
In a dusty old electronics store 
Am    G     F 
They felt an instant connection 
Am    G     F 
They knew they were meant for more 

Verse 3:
Bm7  E7   Am
Clock and Calculator became best friends 
Bm7  E7   Am
They did everything together 
Bm7  E7   Am
They watched The Simpsons Movie on repeat 
Bm7  E7   Am
And laughed at Homer's clever

Verse 4:
Bm7  E7   Am
But then they saw the news one night 
Bm7  E7   Am
About the water pollution crisis 
Bm7  E7   Am
They realized they had to do something 
Bm7  E    A  
To save the planet from this mess 

Chorus:
Am    G     F  
So they decided to use their skills  
Am    G     F  
To build a machine that could clean the water  
Am    G     F  
They worked day and night with all their will  
Am    G     F  
They hoped they could make things better  

Bridge:
D      C      Bb      A   
But their machine was too powerful  
D      C      Bb      A   
It sucked up all the water in the world  
D      C      Bb      A   
It left behind a dry and barren land  
D      C      Bb      A   
It was a disaster they had not planned  

Verse 5:
Em       A       D    
Clock and Calculator felt so guilty  
Em       A       D    
They had ruined everything they loved  
Em       A       D    
They wished they could undo their mistake  
Em       A       D    
But there was no way to turn back  

Outro:
G        D        C     
So they hugged each other tightly  
G        D        C     
And said goodbye with tears in their eyes  
G        D        C     
They turned off their power switches  
G        D        C     
And waited for the end of time  

The End.
