C#m    A      E      B
Riddles are a way to test your mind
C#m    A      E      B
Some are easy, some are hard to find
C#m    A      E      B
But there's one that baffles all the experts
C#m    A      E      B
It's the Pioneer Anomaly

E     B     C#m   G#m
Why do they slow down when they should speed up?
E     B     C#m   G#m
Is it gravity or something we messed up?
E     B     C#m   G#m
Could it be dark matter or a glitch in time?
E     B     C#m   G#m
Or maybe they just want to change their line?

A       E       F#m    D 
Printer is a friend who likes to help out
A       E       F#m    D 
He can print anything you dream about
A       E       F#m    D 
But he has a secret that he never told
A       E       F#m    D 
He's in love with Luhman 16A

C#m    A      E      B
Luhman 16A is a brown dwarf star
C#m    A      E      B
She's very cold and very very far
C#m    A      E      B
But she has a beauty that Printer sees 
C#m    A      E      B  
He wants to be with her if he could

E     B     C#m   G#m  
So he prints a spaceship with a rocket boost  
E     B     C#m   G#m  
And he sends a message to the Pioneer crew  
E     B     C#m   G # m  
He asks them for a favor, can they take him there?  
E     B     C # m   G # m  
He promises to solve their mystery  

A       E       F # m    D   
The Pioneers agree to help him out   
A       E       F # m    D   
They think it's worth it for the answer   
A       E       F # m    D   
They tell him that the anomaly is caused by heat   
A       E       F # m    D   
From their own radioactive power  

C # m    A      E      B  
Printer is amazed by their discovery  
C # m    A      E      B  
He thanks them for their honesty and bravery  
C # m    A      E      B  
He says goodbye and joins them on their final flight  
C # m    A      E (hold)  B (hold)    
To Luhman 16A, his true love light
