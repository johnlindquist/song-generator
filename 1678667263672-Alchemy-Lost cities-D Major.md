# Flags of the World

Verse 1:
Em7       A7      Dmaj7
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel
Em7       A7      Dmaj7
He wanted to see every flag unfurl
Em7       A7      Dmaj7
He started with Georgia, the land of wine
Em7       A7      Dmaj7
He admired their cross of red and white

Chorus:
Bm        G        A
Flags of the world, flags of the world
Bm        G        A
Show me your colors, show me your symbols
Bm        G        A
Flags of the world, flags of the world
Bm        G        A     Dmaj7 (hold)
You're so beautiful, you're so wonderful

Verse 2:
Em7       A7      Dmaj7
Next he went to Swaziland, a kingdom in Africa
Em7       A7      Dmaj7
He saw their flag with blue, yellow and red stripes 
Em7       A7      Dmaj7 
And a shield and spears in the center 
Em7       A7      Dmaj7 
He learned about their culture and history 

(Repeat chorus)

Verse 3:
Em7       A7      Dmaj7 
Then he flew to Tonga, an island in the Pacific 
Em7       A7      Dmaj7 
He was amazed by their flag with a red cross on white 
Em7       A8      Dmaj9 
And a red background symbolizing bloodshed 
Em8       Bb9     C#dim9  
And sacrifice for freedom 

(Repeat chorus)

Bridge:
F#m       Bm     Em    F#
But then he met a girl from Europe 
F#m       Bm     Em    F#
She had stars in her eyes and hair like gold 
F#m       Bm     Em    F#
She showed him her flag with blue and yellow 
F#m       Bm     Em    F#
And he fell in love with her soul 

Verse 4:
G         C         G/B   Am  
They decided to go on an adventure together 
G         C         G/B   Am  
They hitched a ride on Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster 
G         C         G/B   Am  
They soared through space and saw the planets shine 
G         C         G/B   Am  
They kissed under the Perseid meteor shower 

Final chorus:
C         F         G   
Flags of the world, flags of the world (oh yeah) 
C         F         G   
Show me your colors, show me your symbols (show me) 
C         F         G   
Flags of the world, flags of the world (I love you) 
C         F         G     C (hold)  
You're so beautiful, you're so wonderful (you're my flag)
