Here is the song I composed for you. I hope you like it!

C       G       Am      F       G       F
There's a boy named Jordan who loves to travel around
C       G       Am      F       G       F
He likes to see the flags of every country and town
C       G       Am      F       G       F
He has a fascination with their colors, shapes, and symbols
C       G       Am      F       G        F
He thinks they tell a story of their history and culture

C        G        Am     Em
But there's one thing that he hates
F        C        G      Em
It's the dark side of his fate
F        C        Dm     Em 
He has a curse that follows him wherever he may go
F        C        Dm     Em 
It's the dark dungeons, dark matter, and trash can trio

Am         Em         F          C 
They are his enemies, they always try to ruin his fun
Am         Em         F          C 
They trap him in dark dungeons where he can't see the sun
Am         Em         F          C 
They throw dark matter at him that makes him feel so low
Am         Em         F          C 
They dump trash cans on his head that smell like rotten dough

C        G        Am     Em 
He tries to escape them but they always find him out
F        C        G      Em 
They have a radar for his flag-loving heart no doubt
F        C        Dm     Em 
He wonders if there's any way to break this awful spell
F        C        Dm     Em 
He wishes he could find a flag that would make them repel

C       G       Am      F       G      F  
One day he goes to Africa and sees a flag so bright  
C       G       Am      F      G      F  
It has three stripes of green, white, and red with a blue triangle on the right  
C       G
