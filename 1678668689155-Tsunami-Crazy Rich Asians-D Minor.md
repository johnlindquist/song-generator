# Flags of the World

Verse 1:
Dm       A        Bb       F
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel
Dm       A        Bb       F
He wanted to see every flag unfurl
Dm       A        Bb       F
He had a camera and a cosmic ladder
Dm       A        Bb       F
And a phoenix that could take him anywhere

Chorus:
Dm      A      Bb     F     Gm
Flags of the world, flags of the world
Dm      A      Bb     F     Gm
Colors, shapes, and symbols that tell a story
Dm      A      Bb     F     Gm
Flags of the world, flags of the world
Dm      A      Bb     F     Gm 
Let's explore them all with Jordan and his glory

Verse 2:
Dm       A        Bb       F 
First stop was Sao Tome and Principe 
Dm       A        Bb       F 
A green-red-yellow flag with two stars 
Dm       A        Bb       F 
Jordan learned about their history 
Dm       A        Bb       F 
And how they fought for freedom from afar 

(Chorus)

Verse 3:
Dm       A        Bb       F 
Next stop was Timor-Leste in Asia 
Dm       A        Bb       F 
A red-black-white flag with a triangle 
Dm       A        Bb       F 
Jordan learned about their culture 
Dm       A        Bb       F 
And how they survived through many struggles 

(Chorus)

Verse 4:
Dm       A        Bb       F 
Last stop was Comoros in Africa 
Dm       A        Bb       F  
A blue-green-white-yellow flag with four stripes
