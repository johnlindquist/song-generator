I'm so excited to compose a song for you! You're such a creative person. I hope you like what I came up with. Here it is:

Bm   G    A    F#
Jordan was a boy who loved to learn
Bm   G    A    F#
He read about the stars and how they burn
Bm   G    A    F#
He dreamed of going to outer space
Bm   G    A    F#
And seeing all the wonders face to face

D   A   Bm  G
But he lived in Suriname, a tiny country
D   A   Bm  G
Where rockets were a luxury he couldn't afford
D   A   Bm  G
So he made his own out of cardboard and tape
D   A   Bm  G
And launched it from his backyard with a cord

G     D      Em     C
He's Jordan, Jordan, Jordan of Suriname
G     D      Em     C
He's got a big imagination and a scissors holder
G     D      Em     C
He's Jordan, Jordan, Jordan of Suriname
G     D      Em     C 
He's gonna explore the universe when he gets older

Bm   G    A    F#
One day he got a letter from Tuvalu 
Bm   G    A    F#
A tiny island nation in the sea 
Bm   G    A    F#
They said they had a contest for young scientists 
Bm   G    A    F#
And the prize was a trip to Monaco for free 

D   A   Bm  G 
Jordan was ecstatic, he packed his bags 
D   A   Bm  G 
He wrote an essay on the cosmic string theory 
D   A   Bm  G 
He sent it to Tuvalu with his best wishes 
D   A   Bm  G 
And hoped that they would pick him as the winner 

G     D      Em     C 
He's Jordan, Jordan, Jordan of Suriname 
G     D      Em     C 
He's got a big ambition and a scissors holder 
G     D      Em     C  
He's Jordan, Jordan, Jordan of Suriname  
G     D      Em     C  
He's gonna see the world when he gets older 

Bm  G  A  F#  
A few weeks later he got another letter  
Bm  G  A  F#  
It said congratulations you have won  
Bm  G  A  F#  
We're sending you a ticket to Monaco   
Bm  G  A  F#   
Where you'll meet some famous people and have fun  

D       A       Bm       G   
Jordan couldn't believe it, he was overjoyed   
D       A       Bm       G   
He thanked Tuvalu for their generosity   
D       A       Bm       G   
He boarded on a plane with his scissors holder    
D       A       Bm       G    
And flew across the ocean with glee   

G        D        Em        C     
He's Jordan, Jordan, Jordan of Suriname     
G        D        Em        C     
He's got a big adventure and a scissors holder     
G        D        Em        C      
He's Jordan, Jordan, Jordan of Suriname      
G        D        Em        C       
He's gonna have some fun when he gets older      

Bm         E         Ab7         Db7    
When he arrived in Monaco he was amazed    
B7         E         Ab7         Db7    
The city was so beautiful and rich    
F#7         E         Ab7         Db7     
They took him to a hotel where they gave him    
E          E          Ab7          Db7      
A room with a view and an ice cream sandwich    

F#          E           Ab7           Db7       
Then they told him that tomorrow he would visit     
E           E           Ab7           Db7       
The Hubble Space Telescope at its base     
F#          E           Ab7           Db7        
They said it was an honor and a privilege      
E           E           Ab7           Db7         
To see one of the greatest tools of science     

Ab            Eb            F             Eb           
Jordan was speechless, he couldn't wait     
Ab            Eb            F             Eb            
To see the Hubble Space Telescope up close     
Ab            Eb            F             Eb             
To look at
