```
Em   A    D
Flowers and Pastry brush
Em   A    D
They don't have much in common
Em   A    D
But they both have a story to tell
Em   A    D
And they both need someone to love them

G     D     Em     C     G     C
They met at a bakery one sunny day
G     D     Em     C     G     C
He was making pies and she was a bouquet
G     D     Em     C     
He saw her beauty and she saw his skill
G      C      G      C      G      C 
And they felt a spark that they couldn't conceal

D       A       Bm       G       A       G 
Flowers and Pastry brush, they fell in love so fast
D       A       Bm       G       A       G 
Flowers and Pastry brush, they thought their love would last

Em   A    D
But then came the trouble that tore them apart
Em   A    D
She was sold to a rich man who had no heart
Em   A    D 
He was left behind with his broken dreams
Em   A    D 
And he wondered if he'd ever see her again

G      D      Em      C      G      C 
She was taken to a castle where she was locked away
G      D      Em      C      G      C 
He was stuck at the bakery where he had to stay
G      D      Em      C      
They missed each other every single day
G        C        G        C        G        C 
And they hoped that fate would find a way

D       A       Bm       G       A       G 
Flowers and Pastry brush, they never gave up hope
D       A       Bm       G       A       G 
Flowers and Pastry brush, they knew they had to cope

Em   A    D  
Then one night something magical happened  
Em   A    D  
The castle was enchanted by a fairy godmother  
Em   A    D  
She turned the flowers into a beautiful girl  
Em   A    D  
And she gave her a chance to see the world  

G        D        Em        C        G        C   
She ran away from the castle as fast as she could  
G        D        Em        C        G        C   
She knew where she wanted to go and what she should do  
G         D         Em         C       
She found her way back to the bakery shop  
G          C          G          C          G          c   
And she looked for her pastry brush who never stopped  

D         A         Bm         g         a         g   
Flowers and Pastry brush, they finally reunited  
D         a         bm         g         a         g   
Flowers and pastry brush, they were so delighted  

em  -  d  -  c  -  b7    
But their happiness was short-lived    
em  -  d  -  c  -  b7    
Because the rich man followed her trail    
em  -  d  -  c  - b7     
He wanted his flowers back at any cost    
em - d - c - b7     
And he didn't care who he crossed    

g           d           em           c           g           c   
He stormed into the bakery with an angry face    
g           d           em           c           g           c   
He grabbed the flowers by the hair and dragged her out of place    
g            d            em            c            
He didn't notice that she was human now    
g             c             g             c             g             c   
He only saw his property that he had to take somehow    

d            a            bm            g            a            g   
Flowers and pastry brush, they tried to fight him off    
d            a            bm            g            a            g   
Flowers and pastry brush, they didn't want to be lost    

em              d              cmaj7              b7             
But then something unexpected happened that changed everything     
em              d              cmaj7              b7             
A cyclist came by on his bike and he wore an earring     
em              d              cmaj7              b7             
His name was Lance Armstrong and he had an idea
