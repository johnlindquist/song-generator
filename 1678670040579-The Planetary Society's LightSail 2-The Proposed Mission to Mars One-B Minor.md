Here is my song about the flags of the world. I hope you like it!

Bm   A   G
There's a boy named Jordan who loves to fly
Bm   A   G
On his magic broomstick across the sky
Bm   A   G
He likes to see all the flags unfurl
Bm   A   G
And learn about their stories from around the world

Em  F#  Bm
He sees Comoros with its four stars
Em  F#  Bm
Green for Islam and white for peace so far
Em  F#  Bm
Yellow for sunshine and red for bloodshed
Em  F#  Bm 
And a crescent moon to light up his head

Chorus:
D    A    G 
Oh, oh, oh, what a sight to behold
D    A    G 
All these flags with their colors so bold
D    A    G 
They tell us stories of history and culture
D    A    G 
And make us feel like we're part of something bigger

Bm   A   G 
He flies to Laos with its red stripes
Bm   A   G 
Symbolizing blood of those who fight
Bm   A   G 
And a blue band for prosperity and wealth
Bm   A   G 
And a white disk for unity and health

Em  F#  Bm 
He sees Nauru with its yellow line
Em  F#  Bm 
Representing the equator that's so fine
Em  F#  Bm 
And a blue field for the Pacific Ocean deep
Em  F#  Bm  
And a white star for their island home so sweet

Chorus:
D    A    G 
Oh, oh, oh, what a sight to behold
D    A    G 
All these flags with their colors so bold
D    A    G 
They tell us stories of history and culture
D    A    G 
And make us feel like we're part of something bigger

Bridge:
F#     Em     D      C#
But Jordan has a secret that he can't reveal  
F#     Em     D      C#
He dreams of flying to Omega Centauri  
F#     Em     D      C#
The brightest globular cluster in our galaxy  
F#     Em     D      C#
Where he hopes to find his true love waiting for him  

G       F#
She's a chimera with wings of fire  
G       F#
And eyes of sapphire  
G       F#
She's beautiful and fierce  
G       F#
She's his heart's desire  

Chorus:
D    A    G 
Oh, oh, oh, what a sight to behold  
D    A    G   
All these flags with their colors so bold  
D    A    G   
They tell us stories of history and culture  
D    A    
But they can't compare to his love that's out of this world  

Outro:   
G   
Oh, oh, oh (repeat until fade out)
