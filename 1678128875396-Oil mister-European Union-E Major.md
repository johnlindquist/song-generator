Sure, I can try to write a song for you. Here is what I came up with:

```
Verse 1:
E             B              C#m
I bought an oil mister from a store
A             B              E
It was supposed to make my food taste better
E             B              C#m
But when I sprayed it on my salad greens
A             B              E
It started talking in a foreign accent

Chorus:
F#m            B              E
It said "I'm from the European Union"
F#m            B              E
"I'm here to regulate your cooking"
F#m            B              E
"You need to follow all these rules and standards"
A             B              E
"Or else you'll face some serious consequences"

Verse 2:
E             B              C#m
I was shocked and scared by what I heard
A             B              E
I didn't know what to do or say
E             B              C#m
The oil mister kept on lecturing me 
A             B              E 
About food safety and environmental policy

Chorus:
F#m            B              E 
It said "I'm from the European Union"
F#m            B              E 
"I'm here to regulate your cooking"
F#m            B              E 
"You need to follow all these rules and standards"
A             B              E 
"Or else you'll face some serious consequences"

Bridge:
C#m           A               F#m  
Then it told me something even stranger 
C#m           A               F#m  
It said it had a secret mission 
C#m           A               F#m  
It was looking for a magic ring 
B                              A   
That could destroy the world if it fell into the wrong hands 

Verse 3:
E             B               C#m  
I realized then that it was crazy 
A             B               E   
It must have watched too many movies 
E             B               C#m  
I grabbed a pillow and I smothered it 
A             B               E   
I hoped that would be the end of it 

Chorus: 
F#m            B               E   
But then I heard a voice from under the pillow 
F#m            B               E   
It said "You can't get rid of me that easily" 
F#m            B               E   
"I'm from the European Union" 
A             B               E   
"And I will never stop regulating you" 

Outro: (fade out) 
E   A   F#
