Here is the song I generated for you:

```markdown
D             A
There's a star that wanders
Bm            G
Through the galaxy
D              A
It's called The Wandering Kite
Bm             G
And it likes to be free

D              A
But one day it saw something
Bm             G
That caught its eye
D              A
A young stellar disk 
Bm            G 
With a spiral tie

G           D          A         Bm 
It was HD 135344B, a beauty in the sky
G           D          A         Bm 
The Wandering Kite wanted to get closer and say hi

D            F#
But how could it approach her?
G            A 
What could it say?
D            F#
It needed some help from 
G            A 
AI marketing today

G           D          F#        Bm 
So it used its wallet to buy some ads online
G           D          F#        Bm 
To impress HD 135344B with its clever lines

D             A  
It said "You're so bright and shiny"
Bm            G  
"You make me feel alive"
D             A  
"Let's go on an adventure"
Bm            G  
"Let's take a cosmic dive"

D             A  
But HD 135344B was not amused at all
Bm            G  
She thought The Wandering Kite was rude and very small

G           D          A         Bm 
She said "You don't know me, you're just a passing star"
G           D          A         Bm 
"You can't buy my love with your silly ads from afar"

D             F#
The Wandering Kite felt sad and hurt
G             A  
It realized its mistake
D             F#
It had been too forward and too fast
G             A  
It had been too fake

G           D          F#        Bm 
So it apologized to HD 135344B and said goodbye
G           D          F#        Bm 
And continued on its journey with a tear in its eye
