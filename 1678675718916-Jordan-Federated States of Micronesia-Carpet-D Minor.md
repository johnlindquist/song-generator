Okay, I'll do my best to compose a song for you. Here it is:

```markdown
Dm             Gm            A             Gm
Jordan was an 11-year-old boy who lived in Samoa
Dm             Gm            A             Gm
He had a dream of seeing the world beyond his home-a
Dm             Gm            A             Gm
He saved up all his money from selling flowers and perfume
Dm             Gm            A             Gm
And bought a ticket to the Federated States of Micronesia

Bb            F              C              Bb
But when he got there he found out that he had been scammed
Bb            F              C              Bb
The plane was just a carpet with a propeller and a fan
Bb            F              C              Bb
He landed in the middle of nowhere with no one to help him out
Bb            F              C              Bb 
Except for a friendly stranger who said his name was Scout

Chorus:
Dm           Gm           A           Gm 
Scout was from the Marshall Islands and he knew how to fly 
Dm           Gm           A           Gm 
He said he'd take Jordan on an adventure in the sky 
Dm           Gm           A           Gm 
They fixed up the carpet with some duct tape and some glue 
Dm           Gm           A           Gm 
And off they went to see the wonders of Oceania

Verse 2:
Dm             Gm            A             Gm
They flew over volcanoes and coral reefs and waterfalls 
Dm             Gm            A             Gm
They saw dolphins and whales and sharks and turtles big and small 
Dm             Gm            A             Gm
They visited islands with names like Nauru and Tuvalu
