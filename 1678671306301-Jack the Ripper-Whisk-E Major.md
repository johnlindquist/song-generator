Here is the song I composed for you. I hope you like it! ðŸ˜Š

E       C#m      A       B
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel
E       C#m      A       B
He wanted to see every flag unfurl
E       C#m      A       B
He packed his bags and took his serving bowl
E       C#m      A       B
He said goodbye to his parents and his girl

B       A        E       
But little did he know that he was in for a surprise
B       A        E       
For every flag he saw had a secret in disguise
B       A        E       
They were not just colors, shapes, and symbols on a cloth
B       A        E       
They were portals to another world where demons ran amok

V-IV-I  V-IV-I   V-IV-I   V-IV-I   
E       B        A        E       
Oh, the flags of the world are more than what they seem
E       B        A        E       
They can take you to places you've never seen or dreamed
E       B        A        E       
But be careful what you wish for, 'cause you might get more than you bargained for
E       B        A        E       
When you enter the flags of the world

E       C#m      A       B
Jordan first went to Afghanistan and saw its flag so bold
E       C#m      A       B
It had three stripes of black, red, and green with an emblem in the middle of gold
E       C#m      A       B 
He touched the flag with curiosity and felt a sudden jolt 
E          C#m    A         B 
He was transported to a land of fire where everything was scorching hot 

B          A         E 
He met a demon with horns and wings who said his name was Zal 
B          A         E 
He said he was the ruler of this realm and offered him some tea 
B          A         E 
But Jordan sensed something was wrong when he saw his serving bowl 
B          A         E 
It was filled with blood and bones and Zal said "This is for me" 

V-IV-I  V-IV-I   V-IV-I   V-IV-I   
E     B    A    E  
Oh, the flags of the world are more than what they seem 
E     B    A    E  
They can take you to places you've never seen or dreamed 
E     B    A    E  
But be careful what you wish for, 'cause you might get more than you bargained for 
E     B    A    E  
When you enter the flags of the world 

[Repeat chorus]

C#m     G#m     F#m     G#
Jordan managed to escape from Zal by using his divination skills 
C#m     G#m     F#m     G#
He read his palm and saw a way out through a hidden door on a hill 
C#m     G#m     F#m     G#
He ran as fast as he could and found another flag nearby 
C#m     G#m     F#m     G#
It was Turkmenistan's green banner with five stars and a moon so bright 

A           G           D         
He hoped this flag would lead him home or somewhere safe at least 
A           G           D         
But when he touched it, he regretted it instantly 
A           G           D         
For he was taken to another world where demons ruled supreme 
A           G           D         
And this time they were not friendly, they were hungry and mean 

V-IV-I  V-IV-I   V-IV-I   V-IV-I   
D  	A	G	D	
Oh, the flags of the world are more than what they seem 	
D	A	G	D	
They can take you to places you've never seen or dreamed 	
D	A	G	D	
But be careful what you wish for, 'cause you might get more than you bargained for 	
D	A	G	D	
When you enter the flags of the world

G	m	F	Eb	
Jordan fought his way through hordes of demons with his serving bowl 	
G	m	F	Eb	
He used it as a shield, a weapon, and even as
