Bm A Em
I was washing dishes in my kitchen sink
Bm A Em
When I saw a flash of light that made me blink
Bm A Em
I looked out the window and what did I see?
Bm A Em
The Northern Lights were shining down on me

Em C G D
They said, "We have a message for you, don't be afraid
Em C G D
We're here to take you on a journey through time and space
Em C G D
We know you love The Renaissance, so grab your suitcase
Em C G D 
And come with us to see the wonders of that age"

G F C 
So I packed my bags and hopped into their beam of light 
G F C 
They whisked me away to a place that filled me with delight 
G F C 
I saw Leonardo da Vinci painting Mona Lisa's smile 
G F C 
I saw Michelangelo sculpting David in his style 

C Am F E 
They said, "This is The Renaissance, the rebirth of art and science 
C Am F E 
The era of humanism, exploration and defiance 
C Am F E 
You can stay here as long as you want, but there's one condition 
C Am F E  
You have to wash the dishes of every famous person you meet"

Dm C G  
So I washed the dishes of Galileo and Copernicus  
Dm C G  
I washed the dishes of Shakespeare and Machiavelli  
Dm C G  
I washed the dishes of Columbus and Magellan  
Dm C G  
I washed the dishes of Botticelli and Raphael  

G Eb Bb  
But then one day I realized I had enough of this  
G Eb Bb  
I wanted to go back home to my own time and place  
G Eb Bb  
I told the Northern Lights that I was grateful for their gift  
G Eb Bb   
But I missed my family, friends and modern days  

Bb Gm Eb D   
They said, "We understand, we're sorry to see you go   
Bb Gm Eb D   
But before you leave, there's something you should know   
Bb Gm Eb D   
You've changed history with your presence here   
Bb Gm Eb D    
You've inspired some of the greatest minds ever"

Am G D    
So I said goodbye to The Renaissance and all its glory    
Am G D    
I thanked them for their hospitality and their stories    
Am G D    
I got into the beam of light and flew back to my home    
Am G D     
I wondered what would happen when I turned on my phone    

D Bm A     
And when I did, I couldn't believe my eyes     
D Bm A     
There were songs about me on Spotify     
D Bm A     
There were books about me on Amazon     
D Bm A      
There were movies about me on Netflix    

A F#m E      
They said, "This is The Dishwasher, the hero of The Renaissance      
A F#m E      
The legend who cleaned up after everyone      
A F#m E      
The muse who sparked a revolution in art and thought      
A F#m E       
The coolest person who ever lived"      

E Minor (fade out)       
That's me...The Dishwasher...
