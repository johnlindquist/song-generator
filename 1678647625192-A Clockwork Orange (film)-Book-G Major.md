Thank you for your kind words and your request. I will try my best to compose a song for you. Here is what I came up with:

```markdown
Verse 1:
Am    D7   G
Jordan is turning eleven
Am    D7   G
He loves geography and flags
Am    D7   G
He wants to see the world someday
Am    D7   G
And pack his bags with maps and tags

Chorus:
G     D     Em    C     D     C
He dreams of flying to Moldova
G     D     Em    C     D     C
A country in Eastern Europe
G     D     Em    C     D     C
He likes their flag of blue and red 
G     D     Em    C     
With a yellow ox head

Verse 2:
Am    D7   G
Jordan saves his money hard 
Am    D7   G 
To buy a ticket for a plane 
Am    D7   G 
He studies all the facts he can 
Am    D7   G 
About Moldova's culture and terrain 

(Chorus)

Bridge:
Bm      Em      Am      D  
But when he gets to Moldova 
Bm      Em      Am      D  
He finds out something new 
Bm      Em      Am      F#dim  
The people there are friendly 
Bm       Em       A       A7  
And they love geography too 

Verse 3:
Am    D7   G 
Jordan makes some new friends there 
Am    D7   G  
They show him around the town 
Am    D7   G  
They teach him some Romanian words 
Am    D7   G  
And exchange their flags as souvenirs 

(Chorus)

Outro:
G        Bm       C        Am   
Jordan is happy he came to Moldova 
G        Bm       C        Am   
He learned a lot and had some fun 
G        Bm       C        Am   
He thanks his friends for their kindness 
G        Bm       C        (hold)   
And says goodbye to everyone
