I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation.

Just kidding! ðŸ˜œ

Here's the song I composed for you, based on your instructions. I hope you like it! ðŸŽµ

```
Em       C        G        D
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel
Em       C        G        D
He wanted to see every flag unfurl
Em       C        G        D
He packed his bags and bought a ticket
Em       C        G        D
To explore the wonders of the world

G       D      Em      C
But he soon realized that flags were more than colors
G       D      Em      C
They had stories, meanings, and histories too
G       D      Em      C
Some were shaped like stars, some had dragons or lions
G       D      Em      C
Some were old, some were new

Em     C     G     D 
So he sang this chorus as he flew around the globe

    Em   C    G    D 
Oh, flags of the world, you're so beautiful and diverse
    Em   C    G    D 
Oh, flags of the world, you're like a song in every verse
    Em   C    G    D 
Oh, flags of the world, you're like a puzzle to be solved
    Em   C    G    D 
Oh, flags of the world, you make me feel so involved

Em       C        G        D
He visited Djibouti and admired its flag
Em       C        G        D
With a white triangle and a red star inside
Em       C        G        D 
He learned that it symbolized peace and unity 
Em       C        G        D 
And how it was adopted after they gained their independence

G       D      Em      C  
He went to Micronesia and saw its flag  
G       D      Em      C  
With four white stars on a blue field  
G       D      Em      C  
He found out that they represented four island states  
G       D      Em      C  
And how they formed a federation with free will  

Em     C     G     D   
So he sang this chorus as he sailed across the sea  

(Repeat chorus)

Em       C        G        D  
He traveled to Bhutan and beheld its flag  
Em       C        G        D  
With a white dragon holding jewels in its claws  
Em       C        G         Bm   
He discovered that it signified sovereignty and wealth   
C         Am7     B7sus4  B7    
And how it reflected their culture and laws  

G         Am7     Bm7  Am7    
But he also learned that flags could cause some trouble   
G         Am7     Bm7  Am7    
They could be used for oppression or division too   
G         Am7     Bm7  Am7    
Some were stained with blood, some were torn or burned   
G         Am7     Bm7  Am7    
Some were changed by force or by revolution   

C          Bm          Am          Fmaj9     
So he sang this bridge as he pondered on his journey   

C           Bm           Am           Fmaj9     
Oh, flags of the world, you're not just pieces of cloth   
C           Bm           Am           Fmaj9     
Oh, flags of the world, you're expressions of thought   
C           Bm           Am           Fmaj9     
Oh, flags of the world, you're reminders of our past   
C           Bm           Am           Fmaj9     
Oh, flags of the world, you inspire us to make our future last   

(Repeat chorus twice)

End on Em.
