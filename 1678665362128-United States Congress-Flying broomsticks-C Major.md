Here is the song I composed for you. I hope you like it! ðŸ˜Š

C       F       Am      Em
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel
He wanted to see every flag unravel
He had a passion for colors and shapes
And he dreamed of flying away with capes

C       G       F
But he had a problem that made him sad
He was obsessed with The Big Bang Theory
He watched it every day on his iPad
And he couldn't get enough of Sheldon's theory

F       G       C       Am
He wanted to be smart like him and learn physics
But he also wanted to have fun and be artistic
He felt torn between two worlds that didn't mix
And he didn't know how to find his own niche

F       G       C       
So he decided to go on an adventure 
To find some flags that would inspire him 
He packed his bags and took his scissors 
And he hoped to find some answers within 

F       G       
This is the chorus of his song 
The song of the flags of the world 
He sang it loud and he sang it strong 
The song of the flags of the world 

C       F       Am      Em
He flew to Guyana, a country in South America 
He saw their flag with green, yellow, red, and black 
He learned that green symbolized agriculture 
And yellow represented mineral wealth they had 

C       F       Am      Em
He liked their flag because it looked like an arrow 
Pointing towards a bright future they could follow 
He cut out their flag with his scissors and kept it as a souvenir 
And he felt a spark of joy in his heart that was sincere 

C       G       F       
But he wanted to see more flags and learn more stories 
So he boarded another plane and flew across the seas 
He landed in Bahrain, an island nation in the Middle East 
He saw their flag with red, white, and five triangles 

F       G       C       Am      
He learned that red represented bloodshed and battles 
And white symbolized peace and harmony they valued  
The five triangles stood for the five pillars of Islam  
Their faith and culture that shaped who they are 

F        G        C        
He admired their flag because it looked like teeth  
Biting into the wind with courage and belief  
He cut out their flag with his scissors and added it to his collection  
And he felt a surge of pride in his chest that was genuine  

F        G        
This is the chorus of his song  
The song of the flags of the world  
He sang it loud and he sang it strong  
The song of the flags of the world  

C        F        Am        Em     
But he still had one more flag to see before he went back home   
So he hopped on another plane and flew over some domes   
He arrived in Qatar, a wealthy country in the Persian Gulf   
He saw their flag with maroon, white, and nine points   

C        F        Am        Em     
He learned that maroon represented sandstorms they faced   
And white showed their truce with Britain they embraced   
The nine points signified their inclusion as an emirate   
Their status and sovereignty they celebrate   

C         G         F         
He loved their flag because it looked like waves   
Flowing with grace and elegance they display   
He cut out their flag with his scissors and completed his mission   
And he felt a burst of happiness in his soul that was brilliant   

F         G         
This is
