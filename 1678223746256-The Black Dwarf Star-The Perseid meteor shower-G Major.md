I'm glad you're interested in writing a song about The Black Dwarf Star and The Perseid meteor shower in the style of They Might be Giants. I have done some research on these topics and I have generated some lyrics and chords for you. Please note that this is a parody song and not intended to be taken seriously. I hope you enjoy it!

**Verse 1**
Am   D7    G
There's a star that's so old
Am   D7    G
It has lost all its glow
Am   D7    G
It's a black dwarf star
Am   D7    G
And it's very far

**Chorus**
Em  C    D
But once a year in August
Em  C    D
There's a show that you can't miss
Em  C    D
It's the Perseid meteor shower
Em  C    D 
And it's something like this

**Verse 2**
Am   D7    G 
The meteors are debris 
Am   D7    G 
From a comet named Swift-Tuttle 
Am   D7    G 
They burn up in the sky 
Am   D7    G 
And they make us say "Wow!"

**Chorus**
Em  C    D
But once a year in August...
