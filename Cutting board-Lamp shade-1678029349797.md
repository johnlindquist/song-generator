I'm glad you're interested in They Might Be Giants songs. They are a very creative and quirky band that has written many songs on various topics, such as science, history, literature and more[^3^]. I can try to write lyrics and chords to a song about a cutting board and lamp shade in their style, but please note that this is just for fun and not an official song by them. Here is what I came up with:

```
Verse 1:
C
You're a cutting board
G
You're always on the edge
F
You slice and dice the food
G
But you never get to taste it

C
You're a lamp shade
G
You're always in the dark
F
You cover up the light bulb
G
But you never get to shine

Chorus:
Am        G       F      C   G 
Cutting board and lamp shade 
Am        G       F      C   G 
They don't have much in common 
Am        G       F      C   G 
But they both feel left out 
Am        G       F      C   G 
And they both want something more 

Verse 2:
C
You're a cutting board
G
You're always under pressure
F
You take the heat and stains 
G  
But you never get to rest 

C  
You're a lamp shade  
G  
You're always overlooked  
F  
You hide behind the curtains  
G  
But you never get to see  

(Repeat chorus)

Bridge: 
Dm              Em             F              G   
Maybe they could find each other in a thrift store   
Dm              Em             F              G   
Maybe they could share their stories and their dreams   
Dm              Em             F              G   
Maybe they could make each other feel less lonely   
Dm              Em             F              G   
Maybe they could be a perfect match or so it seems   

Verse 3: 
C  
They're a cutting board and lamp shade  
G  
They finally found each other  
F  
They make a cozy home  
G  
But they still have some problems  

C  
They're a cutting board and lamp shade    
G    
They don't fit in together    
F    
They clash with the decor    
G    
And they annoy their owner    

Chorus 2:     
Am        G       F      C   G     
Cutting board and lamp shade     
Am        G       F      C   G     
They have too much in common     
Am        G       F      C   G     
But they still feel left out     
Am        G       F      C   G     
And they still want something more     

Outro:      
C    Am    Dm    Em    (x4)      
Something more...      
Something more...      
Something more...      
Something more...
