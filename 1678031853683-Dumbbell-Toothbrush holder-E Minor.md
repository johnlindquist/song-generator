Okay, I will try to write lyrics and chords to a song about a Dumbbell and Toothbrush holder in the style of They Might be Giants. Here is what I came up with:

```markdown
Verse 1:
Am7 | D7 | Gmaj7 | Cmaj7
He was a dumbbell who loved to lift weights
She was a toothbrush holder who kept things in place
They met at the gym where he caught her eye
She smiled at him and he felt so shy

Chorus:
Em | B | C | G
Dumbbell and toothbrush holder
They were an unlikely pair
Dumbbell and toothbrush holder
They had a lot to share

Verse 2:
Am7 | D7 | Gmaj7 | Cmaj7
He took her home and showed her his rack
She admired his muscles and gave him a pat
They cuddled on the couch and watched some TV
He brushed her teeth and she kissed his cheek

Chorus:
Em | B | C | G
Dumbbell and toothbrush holder
They were an unlikely pair
Dumbbell and toothbrush holder
They had a lot to share

Bridge:
F#m7b5| B7| Em| Em/D|
But then one day he got a call from his ex-girlfriend 
Cmaj7| Am| B| B|
She said she wanted him back and she was sorry for the end 
F#m7b5| B7| Em| Em/D|
He didn't know what to do, he still had feelings for her 
Cmaj7| Am| B| B|
But he also loved his toothbrush holder who made his heart stir 

Verse 3:
Am7 | D7 | Gmaj7 | Cmaj7
He decided to break up with his toothbrush holder 
He said he was sorry but he had to go over 
She was heartbroken and cried all night 
She felt betrayed and angry at his sight 

Chorus:
Em | B | C | G
Dumbbell and toothbrush holder 
They were an unlikely pair 
Dumbbell and toothbrush holder 
They had a lot to share 

Outro:
Am9| D9| G6/9| C6/9|
But then she met a baking sheet who baked her some cookies 
And he met a fan who blew him some cool breeze 
They realized they were better off without each other 
And they found new love that made them happier 

The End!
