Just kidding! Here's your song:

D             A              Bm             G
Jordan was an ordinary boy who lived in Laos
D             A              Bm             G
He dreamed of going to the moon and seeing stars up close
D             A              Bm             G
One day he found a rocket ship that someone left behind
D             A              Bm             G
He climbed inside and pressed a button, hoping it would fly

A            G            D
And it did, oh yes it did
A            G            D
He soared into the sky so high
A            G            D
He didn't know where he was going 
A            G           D    A    D    A    D    A    D 
But he didn't care, he felt so free

D               A                Bm               G 
He landed on the moon and saw a strange metallic thing 
D               A                Bm               G 
It was Surveyor III, a probe that NASA sent in '67 
D               A                Bm               G 
He walked around and touched its arm, it felt so cold and hard 
D               A                Bm               G 
He wondered what it saw and did, what secrets did it guard 

A            G            D  
And then he heard, oh yes he heard 
A            G            D  
A voice inside his helmet say 
A            G            D  
"Hello there, little human boy 
A           G          D     A     D     A     D     A     D  
I've been waiting for you for so long"

D              A              Bm              G  
The voice belonged to Djibouti, an alien from space 
D              A              Bm              G  
He came from a distant galaxy that Hubble could not trace 
D              A              Bm              G  
He looked like a minotaur with horns and fur and hooves 
D              A              Bm              G  
But he was friendly and polite, he wanted to make friends 

A           G           D   
And they did, oh yes they did 
A           G           D   
They talked about their lives and dreams 
A           G           D   
They shared their stories and their jokes 
A          G         D      A      D      A      D      A      D   
They laughed until they cried with glee 

Bb          F          C         Eb    
But then they saw, oh no they saw 
Bb          F          C         Eb    
Another rocket ship approach the moon 
Bb          F          C         Eb    
It had a flag of Monaco, a tiny wealthy state 
Bb         F        C       Eb       F       C       F       C       F       C       
They came to claim the land as theirs, they said it was their fate 

C             F             Am             E     
Jordan and Djibouti hid behind Surveyor III     
C             F             Am             E     
They hoped that they would not be seen by the invaders     
C             F             Am             E     
But then they heard a loud explosion that shook the ground     
C             F             Am             E     
The Monacans had blown up their rocket ship with a bomb     

F           E           Am      
And they cried, oh yes they cried      
F           E           Am      
They realized they were stuck on the moon      
F           E           Am      
They had no way to get back home      
F          E        Am     F     Am     F     Am     F     Am       
They hugged each other tight in fear      

Am                 E                 F                 C         
But then they smiled, oh yes they smiled         
Am                 E                 F                 C         
They realized they still had each other         
Am                 E                 F                 C         
They decided to make the best of it         
Am                E         C        E        C        E        C        E        
They built a home out of Surveyor III        

C                  E                  F                  C          
And they lived happily ever after on the moon          
C                  E                  F                  C          
Jordan and Djibouti became best friends forever          
C                  E                  F                  C          
They explored the craters and the mountains every day          
C                 E         C       (repeat until fade)           
They sang this song together all along
