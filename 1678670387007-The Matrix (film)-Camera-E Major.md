Here is the song I composed for you. I hope you like it!

Verse 1:
F#m7    B7     Emaj7
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel
F#m7    B7     Emaj7
He wanted to see every flag unfurl
F#m7    B7     Emaj7
He packed his bags and flew across the ocean
F#m7    B7     Emaj7
But he didn't know he'd meet a girl

Chorus:
C#m7    F#9    BMaj9
She was from Liechtenstein, a tiny country
C#m7    F#9    BMaj9
Her flag was blue and red with a golden crown
C#m7    F#9    BMaj9
She said she liked his smile and his sense of wonder
C#m7    F#9    BMaj9   E6/9 
And she invited him to stay in her town

Verse 2:
F#m7    B7     Emaj7
They spent some days exploring the mountains
F#m7    B7     Emaj7 
They saw the castles and the museums too 
F#m7    B7     Emaj7 
He told her about his passion for astronomy 
F#m7    B7     Emaj7 
And how he dreamed of seeing dark matter

Chorus:
C#m7   F#9   BMaj9 
She said she knew a place where they could watch the stars 
C#m  F  BMa  C#
She took him to a field with a telescope 
C m F BMa C#
She pointed out the Crab Pulsar, a neutron star 
C m F BMa C#
And she kissed him softly as they hoped 

Bridge: 
Am   D   Gmaj  
But then he got a call from his home country  
Am   D   Gmaj  
There was an outbreak of influenza pandemic  
Am   D   Gmaj  
He had to leave right away or he'd be quarantined  
Am   D   Gmaj  
He said goodbye to her with tears in his eyes 

Verse 3: 
F m B Ema   
He flew back to his land with a heavy heart   
F m B Ema   
He missed her so much but he couldn't contact her   
F m B Ema   
He tried to distract himself by studying flags   
F m B Ema   
And he learned something that made him shiver 

Chorus: 
C m F BMa   
The flag of Cyprus had an olive branch and an orange map   
C m F BMa   
The flag of Malta had a cross and two colors split in half   
C m F BMa   
But the flag of Liechtenstein had no distinctive mark at all    
C m F BMa E6/    
It was identical to Haiti's flag before they changed it in '06  

Outro: 
E6/9    
Oh no, oh no, oh no  
E6/9    
What did he do, what did he do, what did he do  
E6/9    
Who was she, who was she, who was she  
E6/9    
The end.
