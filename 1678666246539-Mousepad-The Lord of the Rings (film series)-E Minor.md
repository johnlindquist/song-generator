Okay, I will try my best to compose a song for you. Here is what I came up with:

```markdown
Em    C     G     D
Jordan was a boy who loved the flags of the world
Em    C     G     D
He collected them all and hung them on his wall
Em    C     G     D
He admired their colors, shapes, and symbols
Em    C     G     D
He dreamed of traveling to every country

C      G      Am      F      G      F
But one day he woke up to a terrible sight
C      G      Am      F      G      F
The flags were gone, replaced by zombies in the night
C      G      Am      F       G       F 
He grabbed his sword and ran outside to fight
C       G        Am        F         G         F 
He saw a banner flying high, it was the flag of Kosovo

Em    C     G     D 
The flag of Kosovo is blue with a yellow map and stars
Em    C     G     D 
It represents the people's hope for peace and freedom after wars
Em    C     G     D 
Jordan slashed his way through the undead horde
Em    C     G     D 
He reached the flagpole and climbed up to the top

C       G       Am       F        G        F 
But as he touched the flag, he felt a sudden shock
C       G       Am       F        G        F 
He was transported to another place, a land of fire and rock
C       G       Am       F         G         F 
He looked around and saw a ring of power on his hand
C        G         Am          F          G          F 
He heard a voice inside his head, it was the Lord of the Rings

Em    C     Bm   A  
The Lord of the Rings is an epic fantasy film series  
Em    C     Bm   A  
It tells the story of a quest to destroy an evil ring  
Em    C     Bm   A  
Jordan felt a surge of fear and greed in his heart  
Em    C     Bm   A  
He wanted to keep the ring for himself and rule the world  

D      A      Em      C      A      C  
But then he saw an army marching towards him  
D      A      Em      C      A      C  
They were orcs and goblins led by a dark lord  
D      A      Em       C        A        C   
He realized he had to get rid of the ring or die  
D       A         Em           C           A           C   
He threw it into a volcano and hoped for it to melt away  

Em    C   Am  Em   
But nothing happened, instead he heard a roar  
Em    C   Am  Em   
A giant beast emerged from the lava core  
Em    C   Am  Em   
It had wings and claws and scales and horns  
Em    C   Am  Em   
It was a chimera, a creature made of parts  

G        D          Am            Em             D            Em    
But this chimera was different, it had something on its chest    
G        D          Am            Em             D            Em    
It was another flag that Jordan recognized from his collection    
G        D          Am             Em              D              Em     
It was green with red stripes and stars, it was Equatorial Guinea    
G         D           Am             Em               D               Em     
It symbolized unity, justice, peace, agriculture, industry    

Am  B7  CM7  B7      
Jordan felt confused but curious about this flag    
Am  B7  CM7  B7      
He wondered why it was attached to this chimera's body    
Am  B7  CM7  B7      
He decided to approach it slowly and gently    
Am  B7  CM7  B7      
He hoped that maybe it would be friendly    

E5   E5   E5   E5     
To his surprise, the chimera spoke to him     
E5   E5   E5   E5     
It said that it was lonely and needed a friend     
E5   E5   E5   E5     
It said that it had traveled from far away     
E5   E5   E5   E5     
It said that it had one more flag to show him     

A6/9/G# Asus2/G# Asus2/F# Asus2/E       
The last flag was black with green stripes and white text       
A6/
