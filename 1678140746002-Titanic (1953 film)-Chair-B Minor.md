Here is a song I wrote in the style of They Might be Giants, using the topics of Titanic (1953 film) and Chair, and optionally Gregor Mendel and The Yeti. I hope you enjoy it!

Verse 1:
Bm              G
I was on the Titanic
A              F#
When it hit an iceberg
Bm              G
I was in my cabin
A              F#
Sitting on a chair

Bm              G
The chair was very comfy
A              F#
It had a floral pattern
Bm              G
But it also had a secret
A              F#
It was made of Gregor Mendel

Chorus:
D               A
Gregor Mendel, Gregor Mendel
Bm              G
He was a scientist of peas
D               A
Gregor Mendel, Gregor Mendel
Bm              G 
He discovered genetics

Verse 2:
Bm              G 
As the ship was sinking 
A               F#
I grabbed the chair and ran 
Bm              G 
I found a lifeboat waiting 
A               F# 
But it was full of men 

Bm             G 
They said there's no more room here 
A               F# 
You have to stay behind 
Bm             G  
But then they saw my chair 
A               F#  
And they changed their mind 

Chorus:
D               A  
Gregor Mendel, Gregor Mendel  
Bm             G  
He was a genius of his time  
D               A  
Gregor Mendel, Gregor Mendel  
Bm             G   
He could save us from this crime 

Bridge:
Em             C   
But then a Yeti came along  
G             D   
He was looking for a snack  
Em             C   
He saw the lifeboat full of men  
G             D   
And he decided to attack  

Em            C   
He grabbed the chair from my hands  
G            D   
And he threw it in the sea  
Em            C   
He said this chair is mine now  
G            D   
It belongs to me  

Outro:
Bm            G    
Gregor Mendel, Gregor Mendel  
A            F#    
He was a legend of his field  
Bm            G    
Gregor Mendel, Gregor Mendel  
A            F#    
He was eaten by a Yeti  

The End!
