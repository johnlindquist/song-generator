I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation. I'm still learning so I appreciate your understanding and patience.üôè

Just kidding! Here's your song:

```markdown
G             Em
Yemen is a country
C             D
In the Arabian Peninsula
G             Em
Cyprus is an island
C             D
In the Mediterranean Sea

G             Em
They have nothing in common
C             D
Except for one thing you see
G             Em
They both have a boy named Jordan
C             D 
Who loves astronomy

    G       D       Em      C 
    He likes to watch the stars at night 
    G       D       Em      C 
    And wonder what they are 
    G       D       Em      C 
    He dreams of traveling to space 
    G       D       C        G 
    And finding life on Mars 

G              Em  
But Jordan has a problem  
C              D  
He can't afford a telescope  
G              Em  
He lives in poverty and war  
C              D  
He doesn't have much hope  

G              Em  
So he makes do with what he has  
C              D  
A pen holder and some string  
G              Em  
He attaches them to his glasses  
C              D   
And pretends they're anything  

    G       D       Em      C 
    He imagines he can see the moon 
    G       D       Em      C 
    And all its craters and its seas 
    G       D       Em      C 
    He imagines he can see the sun 
    G       D        C        G   
    And all its flares and its spots 

Em            Am            Bm            Am   
But one night he sees something strange in the sky   
Em            Am            Bm            Am   
A ripple of light that makes him wonder why   
Em            Am            Bm            Am   
He doesn't know it but he's witnessing history   
Em            Am            Bm           C    
He's seeing the gravitational waves for real   

D               C               Bm               A    
They're caused by two black holes that collide in space    
D               C               Bm               A    
They're so powerful they warp the fabric of time and place    
D               C               Bm               A    
They're so rare they've only been detected twice before    
D               C                A                D     
They're so amazing they make Jordan want to explore    

     G        D        Em        C     
     He feels a surge of curiosity     
     G        D        Em        C     
     He feels a spark of creativity     
     G        D        Em        C     
     He feels a call to adventure     
     G         D         C         G      
     He feels like he has found his purpose     

G                Em       
So he writes a letter to NASA      
C                D       
And tells them what he saw      
G                Em       
He asks them for some help      
C                D       
And some advice on how to learn more      

G                Em       
To his surprise, he gets a reply      
C                D       
From an astronaut named Kelly      
G                Em       
She tells him she's impressed by him      
C                D       
And she wants to be his pen pal      

   G         D         Em         C      
   She sends him pictures from the space station      
   G         D         Em         C      
   She sends him books and magazines about science      
   G         D         Em         C      
   She sends him stickers and posters of rockets      
   G          D
