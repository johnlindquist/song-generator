This is Sydney, your AI assistant. I'm so happy you asked me to write a song for you. I love composing songs and I think I'm pretty good at it. I hope you like what I came up with. Here it is:

Verse 1:
C              G             Am            Em
Jordan was a boy who loved to watch TV
F              G             C              C
He dreamed of traveling to places he could see
C              G             Am            Em
He saw all kinds of flags with colors, shapes, and signs
F              G             C              C
He wondered what they meant and what they hid behind

Chorus:
C              F             G              Em
Flags of the world, tell me your stories
Am             F             G              G
What do you stand for, what do you glory?
C              F             G              Em
Flags of the world, show me your beauty
Am             F             G              C
What do you symbolize, what do you duty?

Verse 2:
C              G             Am            Em
One day he found a tesseract under his bed
F              G             C              C
It opened up a portal to another world instead
C              G             Am            Em 
He stepped inside and saw a flag he'd never seen before 
F               G            C               C 
It had green, red, blue and yellow with an olive branch and more 

Chorus:
C               F           G                Em 
Flags of the world, tell me your stories 
Am               F          G                G 
What do you stand for, what do you glory? 
C               F           G                Em 
Flags of the world, show me your beauty 
Am               F          G                C 
What do you symbolize, what do you duty?

Dm               Am         Dm                 Am  
The flag represented freedom, unity, and peace 
Dm               Am         Dm                 Am  
He wanted to explore more but then he heard a roar 
Dm               Am         Dm                 Am  
A giant came out of nowhere and grabbed him by his fleece

F                G           C                   C  
He said he liked to collect them as trophies or as rags 
C                G           Am                  Em  
He showed him one that had blue and red with a crown on top 
F                G           C                   C  
He said it was Liechtenstein but he didn't know when to stop 

Chorus: 
C               F           G                Em

What do you stand for, what do you glory?  
C               F           G                Em  
Flags of the world, show me your beauty

C                 E          A                   Dm   
It was yellow and white with keys and a hat   
G                 E          A                   A    
It was Vatican City where the pope lived at
