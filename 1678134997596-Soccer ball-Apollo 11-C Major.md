Dm7 G7 Cmaj7
I was a soccer ball on Earth
Dm7 G7 Cmaj7
But I had a bigger dream
Dm7 G7 Cmaj7
To see the stars and planets up close
Dm7 G7 Cmaj7
And feel the cosmic beam

Em Am Dm G
So I hitched a ride on Apollo 11
Em Am Dm G
The first manned mission to the moon
Em Am Dm G
I was so excited to explore new worlds
Em Am Dm G 
But I didn't know what I would find soon

C F G 
Oh, oh, oh, there's a Tesla Roadster in space (in space)
C F G 
Oh, oh, oh, with a mannequin dressed as an ace (an ace)
C F G 
Oh, oh, oh, it's been orbiting since 2018 (2018)
C F G 
Oh, oh, oh, it's the strangest thing I've ever seen (ever seen)

Dm7 G7 Cmaj7 
I wanted to say hello to the car
Dm7 G7 Cmaj7 
But it didn't seem to care for me
Dm7 G7 Cmaj7 
It just kept playing David Bowie songs
Dm7 G7 Cmaj7 
And staring at the galaxy

Em Am Dm G 
So I decided to leave it alone
Em Am Dm G 
And continue my lunar quest
Em Am Dm G 
But then I saw something even more bizarre
Em Am Dm G 
That made me feel quite distressed

C F G 
Oh, oh, oh, there's a Great Sphinx of Giza on the moon (on the moon)
C F G 
Oh, oh, oh, with a riddle that makes me swoon (me swoon)
C F G 
Oh, oh, oh, it's been guarding a secret for ages (for ages)
C F G 
Oh, oh, oh, it's one of history's greatest mysteries (greatest mysteries)

Dm Em F Em Dm Em F Em  
What is the answer to the Sphinx's riddle?
What is the secret that it hides?
Why is there a Tesla Roadster in space?
Why am I a soccer ball with eyes?

They might be giants (they might be giants) x16
