I'm glad you asked me to write a song about a pastry brush and vases in the style of They Might Be Giants. I enjoy their songs and their quirky humor. Here is my attempt at writing a parody song for you. I hope you like it.

**Pastry Brush and Vases**

Verse 1:
A D E
I was baking a cake for my girlfriend's birthday
A D E
But I couldn't find my pastry brush anywhere
A D E
So I searched through the kitchen, the drawers and the shelves
A D E
And I found it in a vase with some flowers and some elves

Chorus:
D A E
They might be vases (Boy)
D A E
They might be vases
D A E
They might be glass, they might be clay
D A E
They might be hiding something strange today

Verse 2:
A D E
I was curious about the elves and their secret mission
A D E
So I asked them what they were doing with my pastry brush
A D E 
They said they were painting a mural on the wall 
A D E 
Of pillows and trash cans having a ball

Chorus:
D A E 
They might be vases (Boy) 
D A E 
They might be vases 
D A E 
They might be art, they might be fun 
D A E 
They might be making something weird for everyone 

Bridge: 
F#m C#m Bm C#m Bm C#m Bm C#m Bm C#m Bm C#m Bm C#m Bm C#m Bm C#7 F#
But then my girlfriend came home and she saw the mess 
F#7 B7 F#
She was not amused by the elves or their project 
B7 F#
She grabbed the pastry brush and threw it in the trash can 
B7 F#
She smashed the vase and said goodbye to our romance 

Outro:  
E A D  
Now I'm alone with no cake and no pastry brush  
E A D  
No vase, no flowers, no elves, no mural  
E A D  
No pillows, no trash cans, no girlfriend, no love  
E A D  
But maybe someday I'll find another vase above
