Verse 1:
C       Am      F       G
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel
C       Am      F       G
He wanted to see every flag unfurl
C       Am      F       G
He packed his bags and took his unicorn
C       Am      F       G
And set off to explore this big wide world

Chorus:
C     G     Am    Em    F 
He saw flags of red and white and blue 
C     G     Am    Em    F 
He saw flags of green and yellow too 
C     G     Am    Em    F 
He saw flags with stars and stripes and crosses 
C     G     Am    Em    F 
He saw flags with circles, triangles, and bosses 

Verse 2:
C       Am      F       G
Jordan's first stop was Vanuatu 
C       Am      F       G
He loved their flag with black and yellow bars 
C       Am      F       G
He met a girl who taught him how to dance 
C       Am      F       G
And they watched the sunset under stars 

(Repeat chorus)

Verse 3:
C       Am      F       G
Jordan's next stop was Kiribati 
C       Am      F        G  
He admired their flag with sun and waves 
C        Am     F        G  
He joined a group who fought for human rights 
C        Am     F        G  
And they sailed across the ocean brave 

(Repeat chorus)

Verse 4:
 C        Am     F         G  
Jordan's last stop was Bhutan 
 C        Am     F         G  
He marveled at their flag with dragon white 
 C        Am     F         G  
He fell in love with a prince who loved him back 
 C        Am     F         G  
And they flew away on his unicorn one night 

(Repeat chorus)

Outro:
 C         Am          F          G  
Jordan had seen all he wanted to see 
 C         Am          F          G  
He had learned so much from every flag 
 C         Am          F          G  
But he realized that home is where his heart is 
 C         Em          Dm          C   
And his heart was with his unicorn lad 

The end!
