Bm  A   D   G
I went to Paris on a whim
Bm  A   D   G
To see the Louvre and its gems
Bm  A   D   G
But when I got there, what a shock
Bm  A   D   G
The museum was closed and locked

G  A   Bm  F#
So I wandered around the town
G  A   Bm  F#
Looking for something else to do
G  A   Bm  F#
And then I saw a castle fair
G  A   Bm  F#
With flags and towers in the air

D    G    Bm    F#
This is the castle of my dreams
D    G    Bm    F#
Where everything is not what it seems
D    G    Bm    F#
There's a secret passage in the wall
D    G    Bm    F#
And a cosmic portal in the hall

Bm  A   D   G
I entered through the open gate
Bm  A   D   G
And met a friendly guard named Nate
Bm  A   D   G
He said he'd show me all around 
Bm  A   D   G 
But first he had to put me down

G     A     Bm     F#
He gave me a helmet and a suit 
G     A     Bm     F#
And said we're going for a dive 
G     A     Bm     F# 
He led me to a hidden pool 
G     A     Bm     F# 
Where we could breathe under water 

D      G      Bm      F# 
This is the castle of my dreams 
D      G      Bm      F# 
Where everything is not what it seems 
D      G      Bm      F#  
There's an underwater world below  
D      G      Bm      F#  
And a cosmic portal in the flow 

Bm       A       D       G  
We swam through tunnels and caves  
Bm       A       D       G  
We saw fishes and whales and crabs  
Bm       A       D       G  
We reached a chamber full of light  
B m        A        D        G   
Where Nate said we could take flight 

G         A         B m         F#   
He pressed a button on his belt   
G         A         BM          f#   
And we were lifted off the ground   
g          a          bM          f#   
He said this was his favorite part   
g          a          bM          f#   
The cosmic portal to another world   

d           g           bM           f#    
This is the castle of my dreams    
d           g           bM           f#    
Where everything is not what it seems    
d           g           bM           f#     
There's an intergalactic gate ahead     
d           g           bM           f#     
And who knows where it will lead us next?
