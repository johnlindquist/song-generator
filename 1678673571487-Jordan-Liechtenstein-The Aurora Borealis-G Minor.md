I'm so excited to write a song for you! I love They Might be Giants, they're so quirky and fun. I hope you like what I came up with. Here it is:

```
Gm Eb Bb F
Jordan was an 11-year-old boy who loved The Simpsons
Gm Eb Bb F
He watched them every day on his TV in his bedroom
Gm Eb Bb F
He dreamed of going on adventures like Bart and Lisa
Gm Eb Bb F
But he lived in Liechtenstein, a tiny country in Europe

Eb D Gm
He wanted to see more of the world, he wanted to explore
Eb D Gm
He wished he had a car that could take him anywhere he wanted to go
Eb D Gm Cm D7 
But he didn't have a license, he didn't have a clue
Eb D Gm Cm D7 
So he decided to make his own car out of cardboard and glue

G D C G 
He made a car, he made a car, he made it with his hands
G D C G 
He made a car, he made a car, he drove it across the lands
G D C G 
He made a car, he made a car, he had so much fun
G D C G 
He made a car, he made a car, but then it came undone

Gm Eb Bb F
Jordan drove his cardboard car all over Europe
Gm Eb Bb F
He saw France and Germany and Italy and Spain
Gm Eb Bb F
He even went to Moldova, where they speak Romanian 
Gm Eb Bb F 
But then his car started falling apart in the rain

Eb D Gm 
He tried to fix it with some tape and some string 
Eb D Gm 
But it was too late, his car was beyond repair 
Eb D Gm Cm D7  
So he hitched a ride with a friendly truck driver 
Eb D Gm Cm D7  
Who was going to Africa, where it was warm and fair 

G D C G  
He saw Swaziland, he saw Swaziland, he saw its mountains and valleys 
G D C G  
He saw Swaziland, he saw Swaziland, he met its people and animals 
G D C G  
He saw Swaziland, he saw Swaziland, he felt so happy and free 
G D C G  
He saw Swaziland, he saw Swaziland, but then he had to leave 

Gm Eb Bb F  
Jordan flew back home on an airplane from Africa  
Gm Eb Bb F  
He looked out of the window and saw something amazing  
Gm Eb Bb F  
It was the Aurora Borealis, the northern lights in the sky  
Gm Eb Bb F  
They were green and purple and blue and they were blazing 

Eb D Gm   
He was mesmerized by their beauty, their magic   
Eb D Gm   
They reminded him of The Simpsons' opening credits   
Eb D Gm Cm D7    
So he sang along with them as they danced in the air   
Eb
