# Flags of the World

Verse 1:
A             F#m        D              E
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel around
A             F#m        D              E
He had a collection of flags he had found
A             F#m        D              E
He liked to learn about their colors and shapes
A             F#m        D              E
And what they represented for different states

Chorus:
A             C#m        D              E
Flags of the world, they're so beautiful and diverse
A             C#m        D              E
Flags of the world, they tell stories with no words
A             C#m        D              E
Flags of the world, they're more than just fabric and dye
A             C#m        D              E 
Flags of the world, they make Jordan feel alive

Verse 2:
A             F#m        D              E 
One day he met a girl from South Korea 
A             F#m        D              E 
She had a flag with four black trigrams 
A             F#m        D              E 
And a red and blue circle in the middle 
A             F#m        D              E 
She said it symbolized harmony and balance 

Chorus:
A             C#m        D              E 
Flags of the world, they're so beautiful and diverse 
A             C#m        D              E 
Flags of the world, they tell stories with no words 
A             C#m        D              E 
Flags of the world, they're more than just fabric and dye 
A             C#m        D              E  
Flags of the world, they make Jordan feel alive 

Verse 3:
A             F#m        D              E  
Jordan fell in love with her and her culture 
A             F#m        D              E  
He wanted to impress her with his knowledge 
A             F#m        D              E  
He showed her his flag of San Marino  
A             F#m        D               A  
With two green stripes and three towers on white  

Bridge:
F            G            Am           G   
But she didn't seem to care about his flag  
F            G            Am           G   
She said it looked too plain and boring  
F            G            Am           G   
She broke his heart and left him alone  
F            G            Am           A   
With nothing but his flags to console him  

Verse 4:
D            Bm         A            B   
Jordan was sad but he didn't give up hope  
D            Bm         A            B   
He knew there was someone out there for him  
D            Bm         A            B   
He found a new love in SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe  
D            Bm         A          (stop)    
With two green stars on red yellow green  

Chorus: (key change)
Bb           Eb          F           G   
Flags of the world, they're so beautiful and diverse  
Bb           Eb          F           G   
Flags of the world, they tell stories with no words  
Bb           Eb          F           G   
Flags of the world, they're more than just fabric and dye  
Bb           Eb          F           G    
Flags of the world, they make Jordan feel alive  

Outro: (fade out)
Bb           Eb          F           G    
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh...
