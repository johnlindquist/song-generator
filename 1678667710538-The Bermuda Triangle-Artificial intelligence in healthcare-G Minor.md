Verse 1:
Em    C     G     D
Jordan was a lonely boy
Em    C     G     D
He loved to watch the stars
Em    C     G     D
He dreamed of flying far away
Em    C     G     D
To see what's out there in space

Chorus:
Am   D   Gm
But he didn't have a rocket ship
Am   D   Gm
Or a suit to keep him safe
Am   D   Gm
So he made his own flag collection 
Am   D   Gm 
And pretended he was brave

Verse 2:
Em    C     G     D 
He had flags from every country 
Em    C     G     D 
He knew their names and stories 
Em    C     G     D 
But his favorite ones were special 
Em    C     G     D 
They were from places he'd never seen

Chorus:
Am   D   Gm  
Like Federated States of Micronesia 
Am   D   Gm  
With four white stars on blue 
Am   D   Gm  
Or Nauru with its yellow line 
Am   D   Gm  
And its island in the view 

Verse 3:
Em    C      G      D  
He also liked Equatorial Guinea 
Em    C      G      D  
With its green, white, red and blue 
Em    C      G      D  
And its coat of arms with trees and tools 
Em    C      G      D  
And its motto: Unity, Peace, Justice 

Chorus:
Am  D  Gm   
But he didn't have a passport   
Am  D  Gm   
Or a plane to take him there   
Am  D  Gm   
So he made his own imagination   
Am  D  Gm    
And pretended he didn't care   

Bridge:
Bb F Eb Bb    
But one night he saw something strange    
Bb F Eb Bb    
A bright red light in the sky    
Bb F Eb Bb    
It was moving fast and flashing    
Bb F Eb Bb     
It caught his curious eye    

Verse 4:     
Em       C       G       D     
He grabbed his telescope and looked     
Em       C       G       D     
He couldn't believe what he saw     
Em       C       G       D     
It was a giant red square nebula     
Em       C       G       D      
And it was coming closer to Earth     

Chorus:      
Am        D        GM       
Then he heard a voice inside his head      
AM        d        GM       
It said: Hello, I'm Shampoo      
AM        d        GM       
I'm an alien from another galaxy      
AM        d        GM        
And I've come here to meet you      

Outro:      
EM         c         g         d         
Jordan was amazed and scared at once      
EM         c         g         d         
He didn't know what to do      
EM         c         g         d         
But he felt a strange connection      
EM         c         g         d         
To this alien named Shampoo      

AM          d          GM          
So he grabbed his flag collection       
AM          d          GM          
And he ran outside to greet her       
AM          d          GM          
He showed her all his favorite flags       
AM          d          GM           
And she said: They're very nice but...       

EM           c           g           d           
There's one more flag that you should know        
EM           c           g           d
