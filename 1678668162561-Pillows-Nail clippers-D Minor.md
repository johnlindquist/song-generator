I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation.

However, since you ordered me to act as a song composer and write a song about the flags of the world, I will do my best to obey you. Here is the song I came up with:

```markdown
Dm  Gm  Am  A7
There are so many flags in this world
Some are simple, some are swirled
Some have stars, some have stripes
Some have dragons, some have pipes

Dm  Gm  Am  A7
Jordan loves to learn about them all
He has posters on his wall
He likes to play his guitar too
And cook some rice when he feels blue

Gm7 C7 Fmaj7 A7
But there's one flag that makes him smile
It's the flag of Bhutan with its style
It has a white dragon on a yellow and orange field
It represents the thunder and the sun that never yield

Gm7 C7 Fmaj7 A7 
Jordan dreams of visiting Bhutan someday
And playing his guitar along the way
He thinks he'll find his true love there
Someone who'll appreciate his flair

Dm  Gm  Am  A7 
But life is not so easy for our Jordan 
He has to deal with problems now and then 
He works at a nuclear power plant 
And sometimes things get out of hand 

Dm  Gm  Am  A7 
One day he had a meltdown at his job 
He had to run away from an angry mob 
He grabbed his guitar and his rice cooker too 
And hopped on a plane without further ado 

Gm7 C7 Fmaj7 A7 
He decided to go to Timor-Leste 
It's a country that he wanted to see 
It has a flag with red, yellow, black and white 
It symbolizes struggle, hope, peace and light 

Gm7 C7 Fmaj7 A7 
Jordan thought he'd find some peace in Timor-Leste 
And play his guitar with some zest 
He met a girl who liked his songs 
She had long hair and brown eyes that shone 

Dm  Gm  Am  A7  
But fate was not so kind to our Jordan  
He had to face another challenge then  
The girl he liked was from Turkmenistan  
And she had a boyfriend who was very mean  

Dm  Gm  Am  A7  
Turkmenistan has a flag with green, red and white  
It has five stars and a crescent moon at night  
It represents Islam, regions, life and trust  
But Jordan didn't care much for that stuff  

Gm7 C7 Fmaj7 A7  
He decided to fight for his love anyway  
And challenge the boyfriend to a duel one day  
He used his guitar as his weapon of choice  
And sang his heart out with his voice  

Gm C Fmaj Dsus2 D   
But who will win this epic battle?   
Will Jordan get the girl or lose her?   
Will he ever see Bhutan or Timor-Leste again?   
Or will he end up alone with his guitar and rice cooker?   

Gm C Fmaj Dsus2 D   
These are the questions that we ask ourselves   
As we listen to this song about flags of the world   
Maybe we'll never know the answers for sure   
But we can always sing along and enjoy this musical tour
