Here is the song I composed for you. I hope you like it!

Verse 1:
Dm   Bb   F    C
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel
Dm   Bb   F    C
He wanted to see every flag unfurl
Dm   Bb   F    C
He packed his bags and took his tissue box
Dm   Bb   F    C
He was ready for an adventure around the world

Chorus:
F    Dm   Am  Bb
Flags of the world, flags of the world
F    Dm   Am  Bb
Show me your colors, shapes, and symbols
F    Dm   Am  Bb
Flags of the world, flags of the world
F    Dm   Am  Bb 
You're so beautiful and meaningful

Verse 2:
Dm   Bb   F    C 
His first stop was Sao Tome and Principe 
Dm   Bb   F    C 
A small island nation in Africa 
Dm   Bb   F    C 
He saw their flag with green, yellow, and red 
Dm   Bb   F    C 
And two black stars on a white triangle 

(Repeat chorus)

Verse 3:
Dm   Bb   F    C 
His next stop was San Marino 
Dm   Bb   F    C 
A tiny republic in Europe 
Dm   Bb   F    C 
He saw their flag with white and blue 
Dm     Bb     F      C  
And three towers on three peaks 

(Repeat chorus)

Verse 4:
Dm     Bb     F      C  
His last stop was Micronesia 
Dm     Bb     F      C  
A federation of islands in Oceania 
Dm     Bb     F      C  
He saw their flag with light blue and white 
Dm       B       F        C  
And four stars representing four states 

(Repeat chorus)

Bridge:
G       A        D        G   
But on his way back home he met some elves  
G       A        D        G   
They told him they had a secret to tell  
G       A        D        G   
They said they knew a place where magic dwells  
G       A        D        G   
The Taj Mahal, the wonder of India 

Final chorus:
F      D      A      E    
Flags of the world, flags of the world  
F      D      A      E    
You're not the only ones who have secrets  
F      D      A      E    
Flags of the world, flags of the world  
F          D         A         E    
You've inspired me to write this song  

Outro:   
A         E         A         E    
Jordan thanked them for their kindness  
A         E         A         E    
He said he had to go back home now  
A         E         A         E    
But he promised he would never forget them  
A          E          A          E     
Or their gift of showing him how  

To love...  

The flags of the world!
