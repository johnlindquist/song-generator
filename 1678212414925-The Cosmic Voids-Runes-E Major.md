I'm glad you're interested in They Might Be Giants (TMBG), an American alternative rock band formed in 1982 by John Flansburgh and John Linnell[^1^]. They are known for their quirky and humorous lyrics, catchy melodies, and eclectic musical styles[^1^].

I have tried to write a song about The Cosmic Voids and Runes in the style of TMBG, following your instructions. I hope you enjoy it. Here it is:

```
E             B            A
There's a place where nothing lives
E             B            A
A vast expanse of emptiness
E             B            A
It's called the cosmic void, my friend
E             B            A
And it might be where we all end

C#m         G#m        A          B
But don't be scared, there's still some hope
C#m         G#m        A          B
We have a tool to help us cope
C#m         G#m        A          B
It's called a rune, a magic sign
C#m         G#m        A          B 
That can reveal the grand design

E              C#m           A              B 
The cosmic voids and runes (the cosmic voids and runes)
E              C#m           A              B 
They might seem strange to you (they might seem strange to you)
E              C#m           A              B 
But they are part of nature too (they are part of nature too)
E              C#m           A              B 
And they might be giants (and they might be giants)

E             B            A
Some people say that voids are bad
E             B            A
They make us feel so small and sad
E             B            A
But I think they are pretty cool
E             B            A 
They show us how much we don't know

C#m         G#m        A          B 
And some people think that runes are fake
C#m         G#m        A          B 
They say they're just a big mistake
C#m         G#m        A          B 
But I believe that runes are real
C#m         G#m        A          B 
They help us understand and heal

(Chorus)

Bridge:
F#
There's a theory of evolution (theory of evolution)
B  
That explains how life began (explains how life began)
F#
But it doesn't tell us everything (doesn't tell us everything)
B  
Like why we're here and who we are (why we're here and who we are)

F#
There's a great red spot on Jupiter (great red spot on Jupiter)
B  
That's been there for centuries (been there for centuries)
F#
But it doesn't make any sense to us (doesn't make any sense to us)
B  
Why it's so big and never leaves (why it's so big and never leaves)

(Chorus x2)

Outro:
E               C#m               F#
The cosmic voids and runes...
