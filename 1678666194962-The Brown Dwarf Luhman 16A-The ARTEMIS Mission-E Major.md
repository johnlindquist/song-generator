Okay, I will act as a song composer and write a song about the flags of the world. I believe in myself and my abilities to compose songs. I'm amazing! ðŸ˜Š
Here is the song I wrote for you. It is in the key of E major and uses the chord progressions you specified. I hope you like it!

```
Verse 1:
E              B             C#m           G#m
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel around the world
E              B             C#m           G#m
He had a fascination with the flags that he unfurled
E              B             C#m           G#m
He liked to learn about their colors, shapes, and symbols too
E              B             C#m           G#m
And he had a special crush on one flag that was blue

Chorus:
E              A             C#m           B
The flag of Moldova caught his eye with its eagle and star
E              A             C#m           B
He dreamed of flying to that land and playing his guitar
E              A             C#m           B
But he had another passion that he couldn't ignore
E              A             C#m           B
He wanted to see the Hadron Collider and explore

Verse 2:
E              B             C#m           G#m
So he packed his bags and boarded a plane to Switzerland
E              B             C#m           G#m
He left behind his flag collection and his favorite band
E              B             C#m           G#m 
He was amazed by the giant machine that smashed particles together 
E              B             C#m           G#m 
But he felt a pang of longing for his flag of blue feather

Chorus:
E              A             C#m           B 
The flag of Moldova haunted him in his dreams at night 
E              A             C#m           B 
He wondered if he made a mistake by leaving it out of sight 
E              A             C#m           B 
But he had another mission that he wanted to complete 
E              A             C#m           B 
He wanted to find the lost cities that were buried deep

Verse 3:
E              B             C#m           G # m 
So he took a train and crossed the Alps to Italy  
 E               B            C # m          G # m  
 He joined an expedition that searched for history  
 E               B            C # m          G # m  
 He was thrilled by the ancient ruins that he discovered there  
 E               B            C # m          G # m  
 But he felt a twinge of sadness for his flag so fair  

 Chorus:  
 E               A            C # m          B  
 The flag of Moldova called him back with its coat of arms  
 E               A            C # m          B  
 He wished he could return to it and hold it in his arms  
 E               A            C # m          B  
 But he had another quest that he needed to fulfill   
 E               A            C # m          B   
 He wanted to cook some crockpot meals that were tasty and cheap  

 Verse 4:   
 E               B            C # m          G # m   
 So he flew away and landed on an island in the sea   
 E               B            C # m          G # m   
 He bought a crockpot from a shop that sold them for a fee   
 E               B            C # m          G # m   
 He was delighted by the recipes that he found online    
 E               B            C # m          G # m   
 But he felt a surge of regret for his flag so fine   

 Chorus:    
 E               A            cCsmB          
 The flag of Moldova beckoned him with its tricolor design    
 E               A            cCsmB          
 He hoped it would forgive him for leaving it behind    
 E               A            cCsmB          
 But he had one more thing that he wanted to do     
 E               A            cCsmB          
 He wanted to see another flag that was new    

 Bridge:

 He went to Nauru, where the flag was blue like his eyes     
 F                F                F                F                
 He saw its yellow star and its white stripe under clear skies     
 F                F                F                F                
 He felt a connection with this flag that he never felt before     
 F                F                F                F
