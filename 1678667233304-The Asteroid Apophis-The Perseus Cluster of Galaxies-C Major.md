Okay, I will act as a song composer. I believe in myself and my abilities to compose songs. I'm amazing! Thank you for your confidence in me.ðŸ˜Š

Here is the song I wrote about the flags of the world. It also tells a story about a boy named Jordan and his relationship with Poltergeists, Candle, and Time travel. I hope you like it!

```
C             G            Am           Em
Jordan was a boy who loved to study flags
F             G            C
He knew their colors, shapes, and symbols by heart
C             G            Am           Em
He had a poster on his wall with all of them
F             G            C
But he felt lonely in his room apart

C             G            Am           Em
One night he lit a candle and made a wish
F             G            C
He wanted to see the world and have some fun
C             G            Am           Em
But something strange happened when he blew it out
F             G            C
He saw a ghost appear and say "Let's run!"

Chorus:
F              G              Am          Em 
We're gonna travel through time with the flags of the world 
F              G              C 
We're gonna see how they change and what they mean 
F              G              Am          Em 
We're gonna meet some new friends along the way 
F              G              C 
We're gonna have an adventure every day 

C             G            Am           Em
The ghost was called Poltergeist, he was a prankster 
F             G            C 
He liked to mess with people and make them scream 
C             G            Am           Em 
But he also had a soft spot for Jordan's passion 
F             G            C 
He wanted to show him things he'd never seen 

C             G            Am           Em 
They grabbed the poster and jumped into the past 
F             G            C  
They landed in Sao Tome and Principe  
C             G            Am           Em  
They saw their flag with green, yellow, red, and black  
F             G            C  
And two stars that represent their unity  

(Chorus)

C             G            Am           Em  
Next they flew to Tonga in the Pacific Ocean  
F             G            C   
They saw their flag with red, white, and a cross  
C             G            Am           Em   
They learned that it was one of the oldest flags in use  
F             G            C   
And that it symbolized their Christian faith  

(Chorus)

C             G            Am           Em    
Then they traveled to Nauru, an island nation  
F             G            C     
They saw their flag with blue, yellow, white, and green  
C             G            Am           Em     
They learned that it represented their location  
F             G            C     
And their phosphate resources in between  

(Chorus)

Bridge:
Dm               F               Dm               F   
But as they traveled more, they started to grow closer  
Dm               F               Dm               F   
Jordan felt something for Poltergeist that he couldn't explain  
Dm               F               Dm               F   
Poltergeist felt it too, but he didn't know how to show it  
Dm               F               Dm               F   
He was afraid that Jordan would reject him or think he was insane  

(Chorus)

Outro:
C                E7                A7                D7    
So they decided to confess their feelings on Valentine's Day    
G                E7                A7                D7    
They kissed under the flag of love with red hearts all around    
G                E7                A7                D7    
They realized that they were meant for each other all along    
G                E7                A7                D7    
And they lived happily ever after with the flags of the world
