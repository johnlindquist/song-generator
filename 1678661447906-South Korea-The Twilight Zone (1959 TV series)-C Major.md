Here is the song I composed for you:

```markdown
C       F      Am     G
Jordan is turning eleven
C       F      Am     G
He loves geography and heaven
C       F      Am     G
He knows all the flags of the world
C       F      Am     G
He likes to draw them when he's bored

Dm      F      G
But one day he found a strange map
Dm      F      G
It showed a place he couldn't grasp
Dm      F      G
A land where twilight never ends
Dm      F      G 
And people are not really friends

C       F      Am     G 
He decided to go on a quest 
C       F      Am     G 
To find this land and pass the test 
C       F      Am     G 
He packed his bag and took his bike 
C       F      Am     G 
And rode away into the night 

Dm      F      G 
He crossed the sea and reached Korea 
Dm      F      G 
He saw the flag with red and blue 
Dm      F      G 
He met some kids who played with him 
Dm      F        G  
But they were not what they seemed 

C       F        Am    G  
They took him to a secret place  
C       F        Am    G  
Where they revealed their true face  
C       F        Am    G  
They were agents of the twilight zone  
C       F        Am    G  
And they wanted him to join their own  

Dm          F         G   
But Jordan was too smart for them   
Dm          F         G   
He knew their plan was full of sin   
Dm          F         G   
He grabbed his bag and ran away   
Dm          F         Em   D    
And found a plane that flew to Afghanistan   

G           C           D    
There he saw another flag    
G           C           D    
With black and red and green    
G           C           D    
He met some people who were kind    
G           C            D     
And they helped him to escape    

Em          C            D     
They told him that the twilight zone    
Em          C            D     
Was a danger to the world    
Em          C            D     
They gave him a special device    
Em          C            B7      
That could send him back home    

E           A            B      
Jordan thanked them for their help     
E           A            B      
And pressed the button on his belt     
E           A            B      
He felt a flash and then he woke     
E           A             B       
In his bed with his old folk    

F#m         A             B       
They hugged him and said happy birthday     
F#m         A             B       
They gave him a cake with candles     
F#m         A             B       
They asked him what he wished for     
F#m         A              E        
And he said "I wish for peace"
