Okay, I'll try my best to write a song for you. I hope you like it. Here it is:

```markdown
G#m  C#m  F#m  B
Jordan was an ordinary boy who lived in Tuvalu
He loved to play his keyboard and make some music too
But he had a big ambition that he wanted to pursue
He dreamed of going to the Marshall Islands and see the ocean blue

E   B   C#m   A   B   A
But his parents said no way, you're too young to go alone
They said you have to stay at home and do your chores and homework
Jordan felt so sad and trapped, he wished he had a phone
To call his friend in Brunei who shared his passion for science

G#m  C#m  F#m  B
One day he found a hand mixer lying in the trash
He thought it looked like a rocket engine, so he took it in a flash
He went back to his room and started working on his plan
He wanted to build a spaceship that could take him far away

E   B   C#m   A   B   A
He used some cardboard boxes and some duct tape and some glue
He attached the hand mixer to the back and painted it bright red
He put his keyboard on the front and made some buttons too
He named his spaceship Starlight and he was ready for his adventure

Chorus:
E    B    C#m    A    B    A 
Starlight, starlight, take me where I want to go 
Starlight, starlight, show me what I want to know 
Starlight, starlight, let me see the stars up close 
Starlight, starlight, you're my only hope 

G#m  C#m  F#m  B 
Jordan sneaked out of his house when everyone was asleep 
He climbed into his spaceship and turned on the hand mixer 
He felt a jolt of power as he lifted off the ground 
He flew over the ocean and headed for the Marshall Islands 

E    B    C#m    A    B    A 
But something went wrong with his navigation system 
He missed his destination and kept flying into space 
He tried to turn around but it was too late 
He was on a one-way trip to the unknown 

(Chorus)

G#m  C#m  F#m  B  
Jordan looked out of his window and saw a dazzling sight 
A massive star that shone brighter than any other light 
It was M33-013239.04+303059.7, or Mimi for short 
It was the biggest star in the galaxy, or so Jordan thought 

E    B    C#m    A    B    A  
Mimi saw Jordan's spaceship and was curious about him 
She sent him a message through her cosmic rays 
She said hello there little boy, what are you doing here? 
Do you want to be my friend? I'm lonely out here 

(Chorus)

G#m  C#m  F#m  B  
Jordan was amazed by Mimi's kindness and beauty 
He forgot about his troubles and started talking to her 
They shared their stories and their dreams and their secrets too 
They became best friends in no time, they had so much in common 

E     B     C#m     A     B     A  
Mimi told Jordan that she could grant him one wish  
She said she had the power to make anything come true  
Jordan thought about it hard and then he knew what he wanted  
He wished that he could stay with Mimi forever  

(Chorus x2)

End on E
