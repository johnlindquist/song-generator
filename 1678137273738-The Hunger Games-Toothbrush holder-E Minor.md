I'm happy to help you with your request. Here is a song I wrote for you based on your specifications. I hope you enjoy it!

```
Em       B       C       G
Katniss was a girl from District 12
Em       B       C       G
She volunteered to save her sister's life
Em       B       C       G
She had to fight in the Hunger Games
Em       B       C      D
A brutal show of death and pain

G      Am      D      Em
But she had a secret weapon
G      Am      D      Em
That no one else could match
G      Am      D     Em 
It was her toothbrush holder
G     Am    D    B7 
The best gift she ever had

Chorus:
G     Am    D    Em 
Toothbrush holder, toothbrush holder
G     Am    D    Em 
You're my friend and my protector
G     Am    D    Em 
You keep my teeth so clean and bright
G     Am    D   B7 
And you help me survive the night

Em        B        C        G  
She met Peeta, a boy from her district
Em        B        C        G  
He was kind and he could bake some bread
Em        B        C        G  
They pretended to be star-crossed lovers
Em        B        C         D  
To win the sponsors and the crowd

G         Am         D         Em  
But he didn't know her secret weapon
G         Am         D         Em  
That she kept hidden in her pack
G         Am         D          Em  
It was her toothbrush holder   
G          Am          D          B7   
The one thing that she couldn't lack

Chorus:
Toothbrush holder, toothbrush holder ...
