I'm glad you asked. I love They Might be Giants and their quirky songs. Here is a song I wrote for you based on your request. I hope you enjoy it! ðŸ˜Š

E       C#m      G#m      A
I was doing the dishes one night
E       C#m      G#m      A
When I saw a strange and beautiful sight
E       C#m      G#m      A
The northern lights were dancing in the sky
E       C#m      G#m      A
And they made me wonder why

E       B        A        B
Why do they shine so bright?
E       B        A        B
Why do they change their color and shape?
E       B        A        B
Are they trying to tell me something?
E       B        A        B
Or are they just a cosmic mistake?

C#m     F#m     E        F#
They might be giants (they might be giants)
C#m     F#m     E        F#
They might be stars (they might be stars)
C#m     F#m     E        F#
They might be aliens (they might be aliens)
C#m     F#m     E        F#
Or they might be guitars

E       C#m      G#m      A
I decided to investigate this mystery
E       C#m      G#m      A
So I packed my bags and flew to Norway
E       C#m      G#m      A
There I met a scientist named Lars 
E       C#m      G#m      A 
Who had a theory about the northern lights

He said:

E       B        A        B 
They are caused by solar wind 
E       B        A        B 
That interacts with the Earth's magnetic field 
E       B        A        B 
They create electric currents in the air 
E       B        A        B 
That make them glow and flare 

But he also said:

C#M    F #M    E         F #
They might be giants (they might be giants) 
C #M    F #M    E         F #
They might be signs (they might be signs) 
C #M    F #M    E         F #
They might be messages (they might be messages) 
C #M    F #M    E         F #
Or they might be lies 

Bridge: 

A          Amaj7   Dmaj7   D6  
Then one night I had a dream  
A          Amaj7   Dmaj7   D6  
That changed everything for me  
A          Amaj7   Dmaj7   D6  
I saw the northern lights come down  
A          Amaj7   Dmaj7   D6  
And take me to their underground  

There I met:

Gbmaj7  Abmaj7  Dbmaj7  Ebmaj7   
The abominable snowman (the abominable snowman)   
Gbmaj7  Abmaj7  Dbmaj7  Ebmaj7   
Hurricane Katrina (Hurricane Katrina)   
Gbmaj7  Abmaj7  Dbmaj9  Eb9   
They were playing cards with Elvis Presley (Elvis Presley)   
Gbmaj9  Ab9     Db13    Eb13   
And they told me their secret history   

They said:

Fdim    Emaj9    Edim     Emaj9    
We are the northern lights (we are the northern lights)    
Fdim    Emaj9    Edim     Emaj9    
We are here to save the world (we are here to save the world)    
Fdim    Emaj9    Edim     Emaj9    
We are waiting for the right time (we are waiting for the right time)    
Fdim    Emaj9    Edim     Emaj9    
To reveal our master plan    

But then I woke up:

Emaj13  Esus4/Bb Esus4/A Esus4/Gb Esus4/F Esus4/E     
And realized it was all a dream     
Emaj13  Esus4/Bb Esus4/A Esus4/Gb Esus4/F Esus4/E     
A silly, nonsensical dream     
Emaj13  Esus4/Bb Esus4/A Esus4/Gb Esus4/F Esus4/E     
But it made me think about life     
Emaj13  Esus4/Bb Esus4/A Es
