Okay! I'm so excited to write this song for you! It sounds like a fun challenge! Here's what I came up with:

```markdown
Verse 1:
C           G        Am       Em      F
There's a boy named Jordan who loves to travel
C           G        Am       Em      F
He likes to see different flags unfurl
C           G        Am       Em      F
He admires their colors, shapes, and symbols
C           G        Am       Em      F
They tell him stories about each world

Chorus:
C          F         G
Flags of the world (flags of the world)
C          F         G
Show me your beauty (show me your beauty)
C          F         G
Flags of the world (flags of the world)
C          F         G
You make me happy (you make me happy)

Verse 2:
C           G        Am       Em      F
Jordan has a secret that he can't reveal
C           G        Am       Em      F
He has a special power that he can't control
C           G        Am       Em      F
He can shapechange into anything he feels
C           G        Am       Em      F
But he doesn't know how to find his soul

Chorus:
C          F         G
Flags of the world (flags of the world)
C          F         G
Show me your meaning (show me your meaning)
C          F         G 
Flags of the world (flags of the world)
C          F         G 
You make me dreaming (you make me dreaming)

Bridge:
Am              Em              Dm              C 
He sees a flag that catches his eye, it's red and yellow with a sun inside 
Am              Em              Dm              C 
It's from Macedonia, a land of history and culture 
Am              Em              Dm              C 
He shapechanges into a lion and roars with pride 
Am              Em              Dm              C 
He feels a connection that he can't deny 

Am              Em              Dm              C 
He sees another flag that makes him smile, it's white and red with five crosses on fire 
Am              Em              Dm              C 
It's from Georgia, a land of courage and faith 
Am              Em              Dm              C 
He shapechanges into an eagle and flies high 
Am             Em               Dm             C  
He feels a freedom that he can't replace 

Am             Em               Dm             C  
He sees one more flag that blows his mind, it's green white red with a star so bright  
Am             Em               Dm             C  
It's from Suriname, a land of diversity and nature  
Am             Em               Dm             C  
He shapechanges into an anaconda and slithers around  
Am             Em               Dm             C  
He feels an adventure that he can't measure  

Final Chorus:
F            C         G   
Flags of the world (flags of the world)   
F            C         G   
You are my destiny (you are my destiny)   
F            C         G   
Flags of the world (flags of the world)   
F            C         A7    
You make me complete (you make me complete)   

Outro:   
D7            A7            Bb7            A7    
But there's one place that he longs to see    
D7            A7            Bb7            A7    
It's where his heart belongs truly    
D7            A7            Bb7            A7    
It's where he'll find his identity    
D7            A7            
It's where he'll sing this melody
