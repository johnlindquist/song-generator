I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation. Just kidding! ðŸ˜œ I'm happy to help you with anything you want. Here's a song I composed for you based on your request. I hope you like it! ðŸŽµ

```
Em      C       G       D
There are so many flags in the world
Em      C       G       D
Each one has a story to be told
Em      C       G       D
Let me sing about some of them for you
Em      C       G       D
Maybe you'll learn something new

G      Em      Am     C
The flag of Eritrea has three colors
G      Em      Am     C
Red, green and blue with a yellow star
G      Em      Am     C
It symbolizes unity, liberation and peace
G      Em      Am     C
And the olive branch is a sign of hope

Chorus:
Em     Am     Bm     C 
Flags of the world, flags of the world 
Em     Am     Bm     C 
They represent our history and culture 
Em     Am     Bm     C 
Flags of the world, flags of the world 
Em     Am     Bm     C 
They are more than just pieces of cloth 

Em      C       G       D
The flag of Yemen is also red, white and black 
Em      C       G       D
But it has no emblem or design 
Em      C       G       D
It shows the struggle for independence and unity 
Em      C       G       D
And the bright future that awaits 

G      Em      Am     C
The flag of Sao Tome and Principe is unique 
G      Em      Am     C
It has a red triangle and two black stars 
G      Em      Am     C
It reflects the African heritage and nature 
G      Em      Am     C
Of this island nation in the Atlantic 

Chorus:
Em    Â Am   Â Bm   Â CÂ 
Flags of the world, flags of the worldÂ 
Em   Â Am   Â Bm   Â CÂ 
They represent our history and cultureÂ 
Em   Â Am   Â Bm   Â CÂ 
Flags of the world, flags of the worldÂ 
Em   Â Am   Â Bm   Â CÂ 
They are more than just pieces of cloth

Bridge:
Am   Bm   Em   A7  
But there's more to this song than just flags  
Am   Bm   Em   A7  
There's also a boy named Jordan who loves them  
Am   Bm   Em   A7  
He travels around the world to collect them  
Am   Bm   Em   A7  
And he also has some other passions  

D        A        E        F#m   
He loves holy artifacts like relics and crosses   
D        A        E        F#m   
He believes they have mystical powers   
D        A        E        F#m   
He also loves astronomy and space exploration   
D        A        E        F#m   
He dreams of visiting Luhman 16A someday   

Chorus:
A Â   F#m Â   G#m Â   D Â   
Flags of the world, flags of Jordan Â   
A Â   F#m Â   G#m Â   D Â   
They show his personality and interests Â   
A Â   F#m Â   G#m Â   D Â   
Flags of Jordan, flags of his heart Â   
A Â   F#m Â   G#m Â   D Â  Â  E Â  Â  A Â  Â  (end on A)Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â     
They are more than just pieces of art
