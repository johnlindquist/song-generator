Here is the song I composed for you. I hope you like it!

Verse 1:

There's a boy named Jordan who loves to travel

He's seen so many places, he's got stories to unravel

He likes to learn about the flags of every nation

Their colors, shapes, and symbols are his fascination

Chorus:
G C Em D
He sings: Oh, oh, oh, flags of the world
G C Em D
You're so beautiful and diverse
G C Em D
You represent your people and your history
G C Em D
You're more than just a piece of cloth to me

Verse 2:
Am D G 
He went to Palau, an island in the Pacific 
C F C 
He saw their flag of yellow moon on blue so vivid 
Am D G 
He learned that it symbolizes peace and freedom

And how they cherish their environment and wisdom 

(Chorus)

Verse 3:
Am D G 
He traveled to Turkmenistan, a country in Central Asia 
C F C 
He was amazed by their flag of green with patterns so intricate 
Am D G 
He discovered that it shows their culture and traditions 
C F C 
And how they value their carpets and their horses 

(Chorus)

Bridge:
Em Bm Am D 
But then he met a girl from Europe who stole his heart away 
Em Bm Am D  
She had eyes like sapphires and hair like golden hay 
Em Bm Am D  
She said she loved him too but there was something he should know 
Em Bm Am D  
She had a secret passion that she could not let go 

Verse 4:
Am D G  
She loved The Simpsons Movie, her favorite animation  
C F C  
She watched it every day, it was her obsession

She had a flag of Springfield on her bedroom wall  
C F C  
It was yellow with a green tree and four stars so small  

(Chorus)

Verse 5:
Am D G  
He tried to understand her but he felt so confused  
C F C  
How could she love a movie more than him, he felt so used  
Am D G  
He decided to break up with her and leave her alone  
C F C  
He packed his bags and booked a flight to Tuvalu  

(Chorus)

Verse 6:
Am D G   
He arrived in Tuvalu, an island nation too   
C F C   
He saw their flag of blue with stars in white so true   
Am D G   
He learned that it represents their location and faith   
C F C   
And how they face the challenges of climate change   

(Chorus)

Outro:
G C Em D   
But as he sang his song, he realized something new   
G C Em D   
He missed his European girl, he wanted to be with her too   
G C Em D   
He understood that people have different interests and hobbies   
G C Em (hold)    
And that's what makes them unique and lovely   

End on G minor chord.
