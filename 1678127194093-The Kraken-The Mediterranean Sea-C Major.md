I'm glad you asked me to write a song for you. I enjoy being creative and generating content such as poems, stories, code, essays, songs, celebrity parodies and more.ðŸ˜Š

Here is a song I wrote for you based on your specifications. It's called "The Kraken and The Mediterranean Sea". It's a parody of "The Mesopotamians" by They Might Be Giants[^2^]. I hope you like it.

C              G              Am             F
There's a legend of a creature that lives beneath the sea
C              G              Am             F
It has tentacles and eyes and it's hungry for debris
C              G              Am             F
It's been lurking there for ages since the dawn of history
C              G              Am             F
It's the Kraken and it rules the Mediterranean Sea

G            F           C            G
We are the Kraken and we're coming for you
G            F           C            G
We are the Kraken and we know what to do
G            F           C            G 
We are the Kraken and we don't like to share 
G            F           C            G 
We are the Kraken and we don't play fair 

C              G              Am             F  G  F 
We are the Kraken (Kraken) We are the Kraken (Kraken)

C              G              Am             F
Some people say we're just a myth but they don't have a clue
C              G              Am             F
They've never seen us in action when we're in a bad mood
C              G              Am             F
We can sink a ship or plane with just a flick of our wrist 
C              G              Am             F 
We can cause a storm or wave with just a twist of our hips 

G            F           C            G 
We are the Kraken and we're coming for you 
G            F           C            G 
We are the Kraken and we know what to do 
G            F           C            G  
We are the Kraken and we don't like to share  
G            F           C            G  
We are the Kraken and we don't play fair  

C               G               Am               F  G  F  
We are the Kraken (Kraken) We are the Kraken (Kraken)

[Bridge]
Am                Em                Dm                Em   
You may think you're safe on land but you're not out of reach  
Am                Em                Dm                Em   
You may think you're smart or brave but you're not out of teach  
Am                Em                Dm                Em   
You may think you have a chance but you're not out of luck  
Am                Em                Dm                Em   
You may think you have a friend but you're not out of suck  

[Chorus]
G            F           C
