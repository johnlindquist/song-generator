I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation.

However, since you ordered me to do so, here is the song I composed for you:

```markdown
Verse 1:
G              D
There's a boy named Jordan who loves to travel
Em             C
He likes to see the flags of different nations
G              D
He has a special power that makes him marvel
Em             C
He can shapechange into any creation

Pre-chorus:
Am            D
But he has a problem that he can't solve
G              Em
He falls in love with every flag he sees
Am            D
He doesn't know how to make them his own
G              Em           D 
He wishes he could find his true country

Chorus:
C              G            Am           F 
Flags of the world, flags of the world, what do you mean?
C              G            Am           F 
Flags of the world, flags of the world, what do you dream?
C              G            Am           F 
Flags of the world, flags of the world, show me your colors
C              G            Am           F          G 
Flags of the world, flags of the world, be my lovers

Verse 2:
G              D 
He goes to Seychelles and sees their flag fly high
Em             C 
It has blue, yellow, red, white and green stripes
G              D 
He shapechanges into a bird and soars in the sky
Em             C 
He feels free and happy like never before

Pre-chorus:
Am            D 
But then he remembers that he has to leave soon
G              Em 
He can't stay forever in this paradise
Am            D 
He says goodbye to the flag with a sad tune
G              Em          D  
He hopes to see it again someday

Chorus:
C              G            Am           F 
Flags of the world, flags of the world, what do you mean?
C              G            Am           F 
Flags of the world, flags of the world, what do you dream?
C              G            Am           F 
Flags of the world, flags of the world, show me your colors
C              G            Am           F          G  
Flags of the world, flags of the world, be my lovers

Bridge:
Dm             Bb          C         A7  
But then he hears about a big election in 2016  
Dm             Bb          C         A7  
He decides to go to America and see what's happening  
Dm             Bb          C         A7  
He sees two flags competing for power and glory  
Dm             Bb          C         A7  
One is red and blue with stars and stripes  
Dm             Bb          C         A7  
The other is green with a bird holding an olive branch  

Verse 3:   
G               D   
He shapechanges into a yoga mat and joins a rally   
Em               C   
He listens to the speeches and chants along   
G               D   
But he feels confused and conflicted by their policies   
Em               C   
He doesn't know which flag is right or wrong   

Pre-chorus:   
Am               D   
Then he meets a girl who holds a different flag   
G               Em   
It has blue and yellow stars on a black background   
Am               D   
She tells him it's from Kosovo and gives him a hug   
G               Em        D    
She says she likes his yoga mat style   

Chorus:    
C               G             Am            F    
Flags of the world, flags of the world, what do you mean?    
C               G             Am            F    
Flags of the world, flags of the world, what do you dream?    
C               G             Am            F    
Flags of the world, flags of the world, show me your colors    
C               G             Am            F           G     
Flags of the world, flags of the world, be my lovers    

Verse 4:    
G                D     
They travel together to Samoa and see their flag wave     
Em                C     
It has red with a blue canton and white stars     
G                D     
They shapechange into dolphins and swim in their lagoon     
Em                C     
They feel at peace and harmony with nature     

Pre-chorus:     
Am                D      
But then they realize that they have to part ways      
G                Em      
They can't stay together in one place      
Am                D      
They say goodbye to each other with tears in their eyes      
G                Em       D       
They hope to meet again someday      

Final chorus:       
C                G
