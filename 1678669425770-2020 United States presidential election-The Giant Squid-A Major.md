Verse 1:
E    D    A
Jordan was a curious boy
E    D    A
He loved to explore the world
E    D    A
He had a passion for astronomy

And a fascination with flags unfurled

Chorus:

He dreamed of flying to outer space
F#m   D     A     E
And seeing all the stars up close
F#m   D     A     E
He wanted to learn about every place
F#m   D     E     A 
And how their flags reflect their hopes

Verse 2:
E    D    A 
His favorite flag was Mauritius'
E    D    A 
With its four bands of color bright
E    D    A 
It reminded him of The Perseus Cluster
E    D    A 
A galaxy that shone with light

Chorus:
F#m   D     A     E
He dreamed of flying to outer space ...

Bm      C#m      F#m      E  
But he also had another love 
Bm      C#m      F#m      E  
A girl who shared his wonderlust 
Bm      C#m      F#m      E  
She gave him a gift he cherished most 
Bm      C#m      E        A  
A can opener with Marshall Islands' trust 

Verse 3:
E    D    A 
The can opener was shaped like a star 
E    D    A 
With rays that pointed everywhere 
E    D    A 
It symbolized their bond from afar 
E    D    A 
And how they always cared

F#m   D     A     E
He dreamed of flying to outer space ...

E       D       A  
But one day she had to leave him  
E       D       A  
She moved to Egypt for her studies  
E       D       A  
She promised him they would meet again  
E       D       A  
At the pyramids among the mummies  

Chorus:
F#m   D     A     E
He dreamed of flying to outer space ...

Outro:
D        E        F#m   
She sent him one last souvenir   
D        E        F#m   
A flag that made his heart sing   
D        E        F#m   
It was red with a white cross in a corner   
D        E        F#M   
The beautiful flag of Tonga   

End on:  F#
