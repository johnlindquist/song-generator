Beach Ball and Book
by They Might Be Bing

Verse 1:
Dm   Gm   Am   D7
Beach ball was feeling blue
Dm   Gm   Am   D7
He had no one to play with him
Dm   Gm   Am   D7
He rolled around the sandy shore
Dm   Gm   Am   D7
Until he bumped into a book

Chorus:
G    C    Em    D
Book was lying on a towel
G    C    Em    D
She was bored of reading herself
G    C    Em    D
She saw beach ball's colorful stripes
G    C    Em    D
And thought he looked like fun

Verse 2:
Dm   Gm   Am   D7
Beach ball asked book if she wanted to play
Dm   Gm   Am   D7
Book said yes but she didn't know how
Dm   Gm   Am   D7 
Beach ball taught her how to bounce and roll 
Dm  Gm  Am  D7 
Book taught him how to read and spell 

Chorus:
G    C    Em    D 
They had so much in common 
G    C    Em    D 
They laughed and learned together 
G    C     Em     D 
They didn't care about their differences 
G     C     Em     D 
They were happy as they were 

Bridge:
Bb  F  Eb  Bb  
But then came candle and calculator 
Bb F Eb Bb  
They were jealous of their friendship 
Bb F Eb Bb  
They decided to ruin their day 
Bb F Eb Bb  
They set book on fire and popped beach ball 

Verse 3:
Dm  Gm  Am  D7  
Beach ball and book were in trouble 
Dm Gm Am D7  
They screamed for help but no one heard them 
Dm Gm Am D7  
They thought they were going to die 
Dm Gm Am D7  
But then they remembered their love 

Chorus:
G C Em D  
They hugged each other tightly 
G C Em D  
They said their last goodbyes 
G C Em D  
They thanked each other for everything 
G C Em D  
And closed their eyes 

Outro:
Em A B E   
But then a miracle happened   
Em A B E   
The sun came out and dried them up   
Em A B E   
The fire went out and the air came back   
Em A B E   
Beach ball and book were alive   

Final chorus:   
A E F#M B    
They opened their eyes and saw each other    
A E F#M B    
They couldn't believe they survived    
A E F#M B    
They kissed each other with joy    
A E F#M B    
And lived happily ever after    

The end.
