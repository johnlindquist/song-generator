Sure, I can try to write lyrics and chords to a song about a Carving knife and Toothbrush and how they relate in the style of They Might be Giants. This is a parody song, so please don't take it too seriously. Here is what I came up with:

```
Verse 1:
C
I am a carving knife
G
I like to cut through meat
F
But sometimes I get lonely
G
And I wish that I could meet

C
Someone who understands me
G
Someone who shares my dreams
F
Someone who's not afraid of me
G C G C G C G C 
Or my shiny metal gleam

Chorus:
F G C Am 
Oh carving knife, oh carving knife 
F G C Am 
You need a friend who's by your side 
F G C Am 
Someone who can make you smile 
F G C Am F G 
Someone who can brush your teeth once in a while 

Verse 2:
C 
I am a toothbrush 
G 
I like to clean your mouth 
F 
But sometimes I get bored of it 
G 
And I wish that I could go out 

C 
Someone who appreciates me 
G 
Someone who likes my bristles 
F  
Someone who's not too rough with me  
G C G C G C G C  
Or makes me feel so little 

Chorus:
F G C Am  
Oh toothbrush, oh toothbrush  
F G C Am  
You need a friend who's by your side  
F G C Am  
Someone who can make you laugh  
F G C Am F G   
Someone who can carve your name on a wooden staff  

Bridge:
Am Em F Em Dm Em F Em Dm Em F Em Dm Em F Em Dm Em F Em Dm Em F Em Dm Em F Em Dm   
One day they met at the supermarket aisle   
They felt a spark between them and they both began to smile   
They started talking and they found out they had much in common   
They liked the same movies and they both enjoyed ramen   

Verse 3:   
C   
Now they are together   
G   
They are happy as can be   
F   
They don't care what others think   
G   
They are living free   

C   
They go on adventures    
G    
They have fun every day    
F    
They support each other     
G  C  G  C  G  C  G  C     
And they always find a way    

Chorus:    
F  G  C  Am     
Oh carving knife and toothbrush     
F  G  C   Am     
You found a friend who's by your side     
F   G   C   Am      
Someone who can make you shine      
F   G   C   Am    F    G    (hold)       
Someone who can sing this song with you in rhyme    

End on:    
C (strum once)
