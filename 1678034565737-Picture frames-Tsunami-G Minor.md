I'm happy to help you write a song about picture frames and tsunami in the style of They Might be Giants. Here is what I came up with:

```
Gm Eb Bb D
I bought a picture frame at the mall
Gm Eb Bb D
It was on sale for half off
Gm Eb Bb D
I thought it would look nice on my wall
Gm Eb Bb D
But little did I know what it would cost

Eb Cm Ab F
The picture frame was cursed by an ancient spell
Eb Cm Ab F
It had the power to unleash a giant wave
Eb Cm Ab F
As soon as I hung it up, I heard a distant yell
Eb Cm Ab F 
And then I saw the water coming my way

Gm Eb Bb D 
Picture frame, picture frame 
Gm Eb Bb D 
Why did you do this to me?
Gm Eb Bb D 
Picture frame, picture frame 
Gm Eb Bb D 
You caused a massive tsunami

Eb Cm Ab F 
Tsunami, tsunami 
Eb Cm Ab F 
You're so big and scary
Eb Cm Ab F 
Tsunami, tsunami 
Eb Cm Ab F 
You're like a bad dream

Gm Eb Bb D
I ran outside and tried to get away
Gm Eb Bb D
But the wave was too fast and too strong
Gm Eb Bb D
It swept me off my feet and took me far away
Gm Eb Bb D  
To a place where I don't belong

Eb Cm Ab F  
The wave carried me across the ocean blue  
Eb Cm Ab F  
Until it reached a distant shore  
Eb Cm Ab F  
There I met some people who were just like you  
Eb Cm Ab F  
They had survived the same disaster before  

Gm Eb Bb D   
Picture frame, picture frame   
Gm Eb Bb D   
You brought us together somehow  
Gm Eb Bb D   
Picture frame, picture frame   
Gm Eb Bb D   
Maybe you're not so bad now  

Eb Cm Ab F    
Tsunami, tsunami    
Eb Cm Ab F    
You gave us a new chance  
Eb Cm Ab F    
Tsunami, tsunami    
Eb Cm Ab F    
You made us dance  

[bridge]
C G Am Em (x2)
We learned to live with our new friends  
We shared our stories and our songs  
We found out that we had some things in common  
Like our love for Avengers: Endgame and our fear of influenza pandemic  

[chorus]
Picture frame, picture frame (x4)   
Tsunami, tsunami (x4)   

[outro]
C G Am Em (x4)
Picture frame and tsunami (x8)
