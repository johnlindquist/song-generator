Hello, this is Bing. I'm glad you're interested in songwriting.ðŸ˜Š

I have generated a song parody for you based on your specifications. Here it is:

Dm       Am      Gm      C
I was looking at the stars one night
Dm       Am      Gm      C
When I saw a strange and wondrous sight
Dm       Am      Gm      C
A giant telescope was in my view
Dm       Am      Gm      C
It was the Isaac Newton Telescope too

F        C        Dm       Gm 
It was so big and shiny and cool
F        C        Dm       Gm 
I wanted to touch it but I'm not a fool
F        C        Dm       Gm 
I knew it was there for a reason
F        C        Dm       Gm 
To study the sky in every season

Dm       F        C        Gm 
But then I saw something that made me scream
Dm       F        C        Gm 
A giant hand mixer was on the scene
Dm       F        C        Gm 
It was stirring up the stars like ice cream scoops
Dm       F        C        Gm 
And making a mess of the cosmic loops

F        Bb       A7sus4   D7sus4  
Oh no, oh no, what's going on?
F        Bb       A7sus4   D7sus4  
This can't be right, this can't be fun
F        Bb       A7sus4   D7sus4  
Who's behind this crazy scheme?
F        Bb       A7sus4   D7sus4  
Is it aliens or a bad dream?

Dm       Am      Gm      C
I ran to the telescope to find out more
Dm       Am      Gm      C
But I tripped and fell on the floor
Dm       Am      Gm      C
When I got up I saw something new
Dm       Am      Gm      C
A giant kraken was coming into view

F         C         Dmm     GM 
It had tentacles and eyes and teeth galore (galore!)
F         C         Dmm     GM 
It grabbed the hand mixer and started to roar (to roar!)
F         c         dmm     GM 
It said "This is my dessert, you can't have any"
F         c         dmm     GM 
And then it ate all the stars like they were candy

DM    FM    CM    GM   
Oh no, oh no, what can I do?
DM    FM    CM    GM   
The sky is dark and I'm feeling blue (so blue!)
DM    FM    CM    GM   
How can I stop this monster's spree?
DM    FM    CM    GM   
Is there anyone who can help me?

FM   Bbm  AM  DM  
Then I heard a voice from above (from above!)
FM   Bbm  AM  DM  
It sounded familiar and full of love (full of love!)
FM   Bbm  AM  DM  
It said "Don't worry, son, it's all okay"
FM   Bbm  AM  DM  
"It's just a song by They Might Be Giants today"
