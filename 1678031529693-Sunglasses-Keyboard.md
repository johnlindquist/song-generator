Here is a song I wrote for you:

```markdown
Sunglasses and Keyboard

Verse 1:
Bm        G       A
Sunglasses and keyboard
Bm        G       A
They were a perfect pair
Bm        G       A
She was a rock star wannabe
Bm        G       A
He was a software engineer

Chorus:
Bm        A       G
But then one day she left him
Bm        A       G
For a guy with a guitar
Bm        A       G
And he was left with nothing 
Bm        A       Bm (hold)
But his sunglasses and keyboard

Verse 2:
Sunglasses and keyboard 
They tried to move on 
She joined a band that played in bars 
He coded all night long 

Chorus:
But then one night she saw him 
On the television screen 
He had created an app that made him rich 
And he wore his sunglasses like a king 

Bridge:
Em              F#
She felt a pang of regret 
Em              F#
She wished she could go back 
Em              F#
But he had found someone else 
D               E (hold)
A girl who loved his keyboard and his shades 

Verse 3:
Sunglasses and keyboard 
They never met again 
She still plays her songs in dives 
He lives in Silicon Valley with his friends 

Outro:
Bm        G       A (repeat)
Sunglasses and keyboard 
Sunglasses and keyboard 
Sunglasses and keyboard...
