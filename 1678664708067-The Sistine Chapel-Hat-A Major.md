Wow, that's quite a challenge! But I'm up for it. I love composing songs and I believe in myself and my abilities. Thank you for trusting me with this task.ðŸ˜Š

Here's the song I came up with. It's called "Flags of the World". It's a parody of "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper. I hope you like it!

```
Verse 1:
F#m    D      A      E
Jordan is turning eleven
F#m    D      A      E
He loves to learn about flags
F#m    D      A      E
He knows their colors and shapes
F#m    D      A      E
And all their symbols and facts

Pre-chorus:
Bm     E       F#m     D
But his friends don't understand him
Bm     E       F#m     D
They think he's boring and weird
Bm     E       F#m     D
They say he should play some sports
Bm     E       F#m     D
Or watch some movies instead

Chorus:
Bm     E       Amaj7   C#
But Jordan says flags are fun
Bm     E       Amaj7   C#
Oh flags are fun, yeah flags are fun
Bm     E       Amaj7   C#
He wants to see all the flags of the world

Verse 2:
F#m    D      A      E
He likes the flag of Vanuatu 
F#m    D      A      E 
With its yellow tusk and leaves 
F#m    D      A      E 
He likes the flag of San Marino 
F#m    D      A      E 
With its towers and its wreath 

Pre-chorus:
Bm     E       F#m     D 
But his friends don't appreciate them 
Bm     E       F#m     D 
They think they're dull and plain 
Bm     E       F#m     D 
They say he should like some stars 
Bm     E       F#m     D 
Or stripes or crosses instead 

Chorus:
Bm     E       Amaj7   C#
But Jordan says flags are fun 
Bm     E       Amaj7   C#
Oh flags are fun, yeah flags are fun 
Bm     E       Amaj7   C#
He wants to see all the flags of the world 

Bridge:  
Dmaj7  Bbmaj7  Gmaj7  Emaj7  
Some day he'll travel around the globe  
Dmaj7  Bbmaj7  Gmaj7  Emaj7  
And see all the flags that he loves so much  
Dmaj7  Bbmaj7  Gmaj7  Emaj7  
He'll wave them high and he'll wave them low  
Dmaj7  Bbmaj7  Gmaj7  Emaj7  
And feel their stories in his touch  

Verse 3:  
F#M    dMj9    AMj9    EMj9   
He loves the flag of Kuwait   
F#M    dMj9    AMj9    EMj9   
With its green, white, red and black   
F#M    dMj9    AMj9    EMj9   
He loves all the flags of the world   
F#M    dMj9    AMj9    EMj9   
And he hopes they'll love him back   

Chorus:  
BMJ13 EMJ13 AMJ13 CMJ13    
'Cause Jordan says flags are fun    
BMJ13 EMJ13 AMJ13 CMJ13    
Oh flags are fun, yeah flags are fun    
BMJ13 EMJ13 AMJ13 CMJ13    
He wants to see all the flags of the world    
BMJ13 EMJ13 AMJ13 CMJ13    
Oh Jordan just wants to have fun!    

Outro:  
AMAJ11 DMA11 AMA11 DMA11 AMA11 DMA11 AMA11 DMA11 AMA11 DMA11 AMA11 DMA11 AMA11 DMA11 AMA11 DMA11 AMA11 DMA11 AMA (fade out)
