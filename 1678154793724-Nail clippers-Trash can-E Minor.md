Here is a song I wrote about a nail clippers and a trash can in the style of They Might be Giants. I hope you like it. ðŸ˜Š

```
Verse 1:
Am    B7   Em
I am a nail clippers
Am    B7   Em
I cut your nails so fine
Am    B7   Em
But when I'm done with clipping
Am    B7   Em
You throw me in the trash can

Chorus:
G     Am    C     D
Why do you treat me so bad?
G     Am    C     D
Don't you know I have feelings?
G     Am    C     D
Maybe you should reconsider
G     Am    C     D
And give me another chance

Verse 2:
Am    B7   Em
You are a trash can
Am    B7   Em
You hold the garbage inside
Am    B7   Em
But when you're full of rubbish 
Am    B7   Em 
You get dumped in the landfill

Chorus:
G     Am    C     D 
Why do they treat you so bad?
G     Am    C     D 
Don't they know you have feelings?
G     Am    C     D 
Maybe they should reconsider 
G     Am    C     D 
And give you another chance

Bridge:
Em      A      D      G  
But then one day we met each other 
Em      A      D      G  
In the middle of the ocean 
Em      A      D      G  
We were carried by the currents 
Em      A      D      G  
To a place where no one goes 

Verse 3:
Am    B7   Em  
There we saw a monster 
Am    B7   Em  
It was big and green and scary 
Am    B7   Em  
It was the Loch Ness Monster 
Am    B7   Em  
And it looked very hungry 

Chorus: 
G     Am    C     D  
But it didn't eat us up 
G     Am    C     D  
It said we were its friends 
G     Am    C     D  
It took us to its home 
G     Am    C       D   
And we lived happily ever after 

Outro:   
Em  (repeat until fade)
The end.
