Sure, I can try to write a song for you. Here is what I came up with:

```
D             A
Keyboard and Toaster
Bm            G       A
They were the best of friends
D             A
They shared a fondue pot
Bm            G       A
And watched Star Wars on weekends

G             D
But then one day they had a fight
Em            A
About who was more essential
G             D
Keyboard said he typed the words
Em            A 
That made the world go round

D             A              Bm           G    A 
But Toaster said he made the toast that everyone loved

D      A      Bm     G    A 
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
D      A      Bm     G    A 
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 

G             D              Em           A 
They might be giants, they might be small 
G             D              Em           A 
They might be angry, they might be calm 
G             D              Em           A  G  D  
They might be friends, they might be foes 
Em           A  G  D  
But they need each other more than they know 

D             A
Keyboard and Toaster
Bm            G       A
They didn't talk for a while
D             A
They felt so lonely and sad
Bm            G       A  
And missed each other's smile

G             D  
But then one day they realized  
Em            A  
That they were being silly  
G             D  
Keyboard said he liked the toast  
Em            A   
That Toaster made so well  

D             A              Bm           G    A   
And Toaster said he liked the words that Keyboard spelled  

D      A      Bm     G    A   
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh   
D      A      Bm     G    A   
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh   

G             D              Em           A   
They might be giants, they might be small   
G             D              Em           A   
They might be angry, they might be calm   
G             D              Em           A  G  D    
They might be friends, they might be foes   
Em           A  G  D    
But they need each other more than they know   

D             F#7          Bm          E7   F#7    
Keyboard and Toaster, they hugged and made up    
A               E7         F#7         Bm   E7     
They threw a party with their fondue pot     
A               E7         F#7         Bm   E7     
And watched Star Wars till the sun came up    

Bm     E7     F#7    Bm   E7     
Whoa   Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh      
Bm     E7     F#7    Bm   E7     
Whoa   Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh      

A               E7         F#7         Bm   E7      
They are not giants, they are not small      
A               E7         F#7         Bm   E7      
They are not angry, they are not calm      
A               E7         F#7         Bm   E7  C#dim    
They are just friends, they are not foes      
F#          C#dim        F#        C#
And they love each other more than anyone knows      

C#
Keyboard and Toaster!
