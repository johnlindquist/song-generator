Sure, I can try to write a song for you. Here is what I came up with:

```markdown
Verse 1:
Am             F              C              G
There was a monster in the loch who wanted to be free
Am             F              C              G
He heard about a place across the ocean called DC
Am             F              C              G
He thought he could make a difference if he joined the congress
Am             F              C              G
So he packed his bags and boarded on a ship called Titanic

Chorus:
Dm            F               G
He might be giant, he might be green
Dm            F               G
He might be swimming in a submarine
Dm            F               G
He might be Nessie, he might be brave
Dm            F               G 
He might be heading for an early grave

Verse 2:
Am             F              C              G 
The ship was sailing smoothly until it hit an iceberg 
Am             F              C              G 
The monster saw his chance and jumped into the freezing water 
Am             F              C              G 
He swam as fast as he could towards the land of liberty 
Am             F              C              G 
But little did he know that he was followed by an agent 

Chorus:
Dm            F               G 
He might be giant, he might be green 
Dm            F               G 
He might be swimming in a submarine 
Dm            F               G 
He might be Nessie, he might be brave 
Dm            F               G  
He might be heading for an early grave 

Bridge:
Em            Am             Dm             Em  
The agent was a part of a secret organization  
Em            Am             Dm             Em  
They knew about the monster and his plan to change the nation  
Em            Am             Dm             Em  
They had a weapon ready to destroy him on sight  
Em            Am             Dm             Em  
It was a red pill that would make him see the matrix  

Verse 3:
Am             F              C              G  
The monster reached the shore and ran towards the capitol   
Am             F              C              G  
He hoped to find some allies who would share his vision   
Am             F              C              G  
But when he got there he was met with fear and hostility   
Am             F              C              G  
And then he saw the agent who offered him a pill   

Chorus:   
Dm            F               G   
He might be giant, he might be green   
Dm            F               G   
He might be swimming in a submarine   
Dm            F               E    
He might be Nessie, he might be brave    
E             
But will he take it or will he stay?   

Outro:    
A              
They Might Be Giants!
