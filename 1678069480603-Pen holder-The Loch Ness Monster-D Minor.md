I'm glad you asked. I love They Might be Giants and their quirky songs. I have written a song for you based on your specifications. Here it is:

```markdown
Dm          A7         Gm         A7
Pen holder was lonely on his desk
Dm          A7         Gm         A7
He wished he had a friend to share his thoughts
Dm          A7         Gm         A7
He dreamed of a place where he could be free
Dm          A7         Gm         A7
And meet someone who would understand him

Dm          G          C          G 
Then one day he saw an ad online
Dm          G          C          G 
It said "Come to Scotland and see Nessie"
Dm          G          C          G 
He packed his bags and took a watering can
Dm          G          C          G 
He hoped to find the Loch Ness Monster

F           C           Dm        Bb 
Pen holder and the Loch Ness Monster
F           C           Dm        Bb 
They became the best of friends forever
F           C           Dm        Bb 
They swam around the lake and had some fun
F           C           Dm        Bb 
They sang this song and took some photos

Dm          A7         Gm         A7
Nessie was lonely in her lake
She wished she had a friend to share her secrets
She dreamed of a place where she could be seen
And meet someone who would appreciate her

Dm          G          C          G 
Then one day she saw a pen holder dive
He said "Hello, I came to visit you"
She smiled and said "You're welcome in my home"
She hoped to find a true companion

F           C           Dm        Bb 
Pen holder and the Loch Ness Monster
They became the best of friends forever
They swam around the lake and had some fun
They sang this song and took some photos

Bridge:
G#            F            Eb       F  
But their happiness was short-lived alas
G#            F            Eb       F  
For people came to hunt them down with guns (Oh no!)
G#            F            Eb       F  
They had to say goodbye and part their ways (Goodbye!)
G#            F            Eb       F  
They promised to keep in touch by mail (Don't forget!)

Outro:
Dm      A7     Dm      A7     
Pen holder (Pen holder)
G       D      Em      C      
Loch Ness Monster (Loch Ness Monster)
Bb      F      Bb      F      
Best friends forever (Best friends forever)
A       E      A       E      
This is their story (This is their story)
