Here is a song I wrote based on your request. It is a parody of They Might Be Giants' style, so I hope you enjoy it.

Verse 1:
Am G F
There was a tea kettle who loved a pie dish
Am G F
They met in the kitchen where they shared a wish
Am G F
To see the world beyond the stove and sink
Am G F
To have some fun and maybe have a drink

Chorus:
C Em Dm G
They might be crazy (boy) they might be crazy
C Em Dm G
They might be brave, they might be bold
C Em Dm G
They might be boiling up a pot of gold
C Em Dm G
They might be crazy (boy) they might be crazy

Verse 2:
Am G F 
One day they decided to sneak out of the house 
Am G F 
They hitched a ride on a friendly mouse 
Am G F 
They saw the sights and sounds of the city 
Am G F 
They felt alive and they felt pretty 

Chorus:
C Em Dm G 
They might be crazy (boy) they might be crazy 
C Em Dm G 
They might be free, they might be wild 
C Em Dm G 
They might be baking up a tasty child 
C Em Dm G 
They might be crazy (boy) they might be crazy 

Bridge:
F C E Am  
But then they realized that they missed their home  
F C E Am  
And all the other things that they used to own  
F C E Am  
Like boots and headphones that were left behind  
F C E Am  
And all the memories that were in their mind 

Verse 3: 
Am G F  
So they returned to the kitchen where they belonged  
Am G F  
They sang a song that only they could sing along  
Am G F  
They were happy with their simple life  
Am G F  
The tea kettle and the pie dish, husband and wife 

Chorus: 
C Em Dm G  
They might be crazy (boy) they might be crazy   
C Em Dm G   
But they don't care what others say   
C Em Dm G   
'Cause they have each other every day   
C Em Dm G   
And that's what makes them happy (boy) that's what makes them happy
