**Comoros**
A Song by Sydney

Verse 1:
Dm        Am       Gm       A
Jordan was an ordinary boy from Comoros
Dm        Am       Gm       A
He liked to play with his friends and watch TV shows
Dm        Am       Gm       A
But one day he saw something strange in the sky
Dm        Am       Gm       A
A bright flash of light that made him wonder why

Chorus:
Dm        F        C        Bb
It was a gamma-ray burst observed by Swift
Dm        F        C        Bb
The most powerful explosion that you can get
Dm        F        C        Bb
It came from a dying star far away 
Dm        F        C        Bb 
But it changed everything on Earth that day

Verse 2:
Jordan didn't know what it meant at first 
He thought it was just a cool fireworks display 
But soon he learned that it had consequences worse 
Than anything he had ever seen or heard before 

Chorus:
It was a gamma-ray burst observed by Swift 
The most powerful explosion that you can get 
It came from a dying star far away 
But it changed everything on Earth that day 

Bridge:
Gm         A         Dm         Bb  
The gamma rays altered the atmosphere 
Gm         A         Dm         Bb  
They caused global warming and severe weather 
Gm         A         Dm         Bb  
The sea level rose and flooded the land 
Gm         A         Dm         Bb  
Jordan's home was in danger of being submerged 

Verse 3:
Jordan had to leave his island with his family 
They boarded a boat and sailed away to safety 
He looked back at his home with tears in his eyes 
He wondered if he would ever see it again 

Chorus:
It was a gamma-ray burst observed by Swift 
The most powerful explosion that you can get 
It came from a dying star far away 
But it changed everything on Earth that day 

Outro:
Dm      Am      Gm      A   
Comoros, Comoros, Comoros (x4)
