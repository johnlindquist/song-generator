I'm glad you asked me to write a song for you. I enjoy being creative and I hope you like what I came up with. Here are the lyrics and chords to a song about a Car and Toothbrush holder in the style of They Might Be Giants. I used Coffee mug and Mug tree as well to help with the story.

Verse 1:
Dm G C Am
Car was driving on the road one day
Dm G C Am
When he saw a toothbrush holder on display
Dm G C Am
He thought she looked so shiny and so neat
Dm G C Am
He wanted to buy her but he had no feet

Chorus:
Bb F C Dm
So he asked a coffee mug who was passing by
Bb F C Dm
If he could help him get the toothbrush holder for his ride
Bb F C Dm
The coffee mug said sure but he had a condition too
Bb F C Dm
He wanted to find a mug tree where he could hang out with his crew

Verse 2:
Dm G C Am
They made a deal and went inside the store 
Dm G C Am 
Car paid for the toothbrush holder and they headed for the door 
Dm G C Am 
But then they saw a sign that said "No returns" 
Dm G C Am 
And realized they had made a big mistake that they would soon learn 

Chorus:
Bb F C Dm 
The toothbrush holder was not happy in the car 
Bb F C Dm 
She missed her toothbrush friends who were still in the jar 
Bb F C Dm 
The coffee mug was not happy on the mug tree 
Bb F C Dm 
He missed his coffee friends who were still in the machine 

Bridge:
G A Bb A G A Bb A  
They tried to make it work but it was not meant to be  
G A Bb A G A Bb A  
They realized they were happier where they used to be  
G A Bb A G A Bb A  
They decided to go back and exchange their purchases  
G A Bb A G A Bb (hold)  
But when they got there they found out something worse 

Verse 3:  
Dm G C Am  
The store had closed down and there was no one there  
Dm G C Am  
They had no way of getting back what they had bought with care  
Dm G C Am  
They felt so sad and lonely and they didn't know what to do   
Dm G (hold)   
They wished they had never left their old homes that were true  

Outro:   
C (hold)   
But then they heard a voice that said "Don't worry, I can help"   
C (hold)   
It was a friendly tow truck who had seen them from his shelf   
C (hold)   
He said he knew where their old homes were and he could take them there   
C (hold)   
He hooked them up and drove them off with kindness and with care   

Final chorus:   
Bb F C Dm   
The toothbrush holder was happy in her jar again    
Bb F C Dm    
She thanked the car for trying but she said they'd better be friends    
Bb F C Dm    
The coffee mug was happy in his machine again    
Bb F (hold)     
He thanked the car for helping but he said they'd better be friends    

End on:     
C (hold)     
And car was happy on his own again
