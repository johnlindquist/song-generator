Here is a song I wrote for you:

Verse 1:
G    F    C
Harry Potter was a boy
G    F    C
Who lived under a stair
G    F    C
He didn't know he was a wizard
G    F    C
Until Hagrid came to share

Chorus:
Dm   G    C
The news that changed his life forever
Dm   G    C
He had to go to Hogwarts School
Dm   G    C
And learn about magic and adventure
Dm   G    C 
And face a dark lord who was cruel

Verse 2:
G     F     C 
But Harry was not alone in this 
G     F     C 
He had his friends Ron and Hermione 
G     F     C 
They helped him solve the mystery 
G     F     C 
Of the philosopher's stone that he had to find 

Chorus:
Dm   G    C
The stone that could make you immortal 
Dm   G    C
But also had a terrible price 
Dm   G    C
It was guarded by a three-headed dog 
Dm   G    C 
And a chess board that was not very nice 

Bridge:
Am   Em   Dm   G  
But Harry had another friend who was different 
Am   Em   Dm   G  
He met him on a flying carpet ride 
Am   Em   Dm   G  
His name was Ali and he was Muslim 
Am   Em   Dm   G  
He taught Harry about Islam with pride 

Verse 3:
G      F      C  
Ali told Harry about Allah and Muhammad 
G      F      C  
About prayer and fasting and charity 
G      F      C  
About peace and justice and mercy 
G      F      C  
About how to live in harmony 

Chorus:
Dm     G      C  
Harry was amazed by what he learned from Ali 
Dm     G      C  
He felt a connection in his heart 
Dm     G      C  
He decided to embrace Islam as his faith 
Dm     G      C  
And make a new start 

Outro:
C       Am       D       Em   
But then he faced a final challenge from Voldemort   
C       Am       D       Em   
Who wanted to kill him for his scar   
C       Am       D       Em   
Harry used his wand and his courage and his love   
C       Am       D       Em   
And he defeated him once and for all   

Coda:    
F        E        Am       
Now Harry lives happily ever after   
F        E        Am       
With his friends and his family   
F        E        Am       
He still goes to Hogwarts every year   
F        E        Am       
But he also goes to mosque every week   

End on:    
C
