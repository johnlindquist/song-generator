Okay, I'll do my best to write a song for you! This sounds like a fun challenge! Here's what I came up with:

```
Dm          Bb         F        C
Jordan was an 11-year-old boy who loved to explore
Dm          Bb         F        C
He dreamed of seeing places he had never seen before
Dm          Bb         F        C
He wanted to go to Bhutan, Laos and Guyana too
Dm          Bb         F        C
But he didn't have enough money or a way to travel through

Dm          Bb         Gm       A
But then one day he found a magic telescope online
Dm          Bb         Gm       A
It said it was the Kepler space telescope, one of a kind
Dm          Bb         Gm       A
He ordered it with his allowance and waited for it to arrive
Dm          Bb         Gm       A
He didn't know what adventures awaited him when he looked inside

F           C           Dm      A#
He saw the pyramids of Giza and the stars above them shine
F           C           Dm      A#
He saw Apollo 11 landing on the moon for the first time
F           C           Dm      A#
He saw Bhutan, Laos and Guyana, just like he wanted to see 
F           C           Dm      A# 
But then he saw something else that made him scream with glee

D            G            A     D 
He saw himself in another world, where he was a hero brave 
D            G            A     D 
He fought against evil forces with his friends who came to save 
D            G            A     D 
He had powers and abilities that he never had before 
D            G            A     D 
And he realized that this telescope was more than just a door 

G            D             Em    C  
It was a portal to another dimension, where anything could happen 
G            D             Em    C  
It was a way to live his fantasies, where he could be captain 
G            D             Em    C  
It was a gift from fate or destiny, that he had found this scope 
G            D             Em    C  
It was his ticket to adventure, it was his telescope 

Jordan spent hours and hours exploring different worlds through his telescope He met aliens and monsters, robots and wizards, pirates and ninjas He learned new skills and languages, made new friends and enemies He had fun and excitement, danger and thrill He felt alive and happy

But then one day his mom came home early from work She saw him staring at his telescope with a smile on his face She thought he was wasting his time on some silly toy She didn't understand what it meant to him She took it away from him

She said she would return it when he did his homework She said she would give it back when he cleaned his room She said she would let him have it when he behaved better She said she would do all these things But she never did

She put it in her closet and forgot about it She didn't know what she had done She didn't know what she had taken away from him She didn't know how much he missed it She didn't know how much he needed it

Jordan tried to get his telescope back He begged and pleaded with his mom He cried and screamed at her He lied and stole from her But nothing worked

He felt angry and sad He felt lonely and bored He felt hopeless and depressed He felt nothing at all

He gave up on his dreams He gave up on his life He gave up on himself He gave up on everything

Until one night when he heard a strange noise coming from his mom's closet He got up from his bed and went to check it out He opened the door and saw something that made him gasp with shock

His telescope was glowing It was calling out to him It was waiting for him It was ready for him

He grabbed it with both hands And looked into its lens And saw something that made him smile again

He saw himself in another world Where he was still a hero brave He fought against evil forces With his friends who came to save He had powers and abilities That he still had before And he realized that this telescope Was more than just a
