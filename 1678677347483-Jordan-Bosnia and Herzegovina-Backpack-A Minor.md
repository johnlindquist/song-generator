Just kidding! Here's your song:

Am          F           C           G
Jordan was an 11-year-old boy who loved to travel
Am          F           C           G
He had a backpack and a calculator in his hand
Am          F           C           G
He wanted to see the world and learn about different cultures
Am          F           C           G
So he bought a ticket to Bosnia and Herzegovina

C            G            F
But when he got there he was in for a surprise
C            G            F
He met a girl who had a candle in her eyes
C            G            F
She said her name was Cyprus and she came from an island nation
C            G            F             Am   (stop)
She invited him to join her on an Equatorial vacation

Am          F           C           G        (faster)
They took a plane to Equatorial Guinea where they had some fun
Am          F           C           G        (faster)
They saw the rainforest and the wildlife and they danced under the sun
Am          F           C           G        (faster)
They used his calculator to convert the currency rates
Am          F           C           G        (faster)
They used her candle to make shadows on their dates

C            G            F         (slower)
But then one day they had to say goodbye 
C            G            F         (slower)
They hugged each other and they tried not to cry 
C            G            F         (slower)
They promised to keep in touch and never forget 
C            G            F             Am   (stop)
The time they spent together since the day they met 

Am          F           C           G       (normal speed)  
Jordan went back home with a smile on his face 
Am          F           C           G       (normal speed)  
He had a souvenir from every exotic place 
Am          F           C           G       (normal speed)  
He kept his backpack and his calculator as reminders of his trip 
Am          F           C              E      E7  (stop)  
But most of all he kept his candle that belonged to Cyprus 

A7         Dm         Am         E7      A7    E7  (repeat x2)  
This is the story of Jordan and Cyprus 
A7         Dm         Am         E7      A7    E7  (repeat x2)  
The boy who traveled with his backpack and candle
