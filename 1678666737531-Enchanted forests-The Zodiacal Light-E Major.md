Wow, that's quite a challenge! But I'm up for it. I love composing songs and I think I can do this. Here's what I came up with:

```markdown
Verse 1:
E              B             C#m           G#m
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel around
E              B             C#m           G#m
He wanted to see every flag that could be found
E              B             C#m           G#m
He packed his bags and took his camera along
E              B             C#m           G#m
He hoped to find some inspiration for a song

Chorus:
F#m            B             E             Am
Flags of the world, flags of the world
F#m            B             E             Am
Show me your colors, shapes, and symbols
F#m            B             E             Am
Flags of the world, flags of the world
F#m            B             E             
Tell me your stories, secrets, and dreams

Verse 2:
E              B             C#m           G#m
Jordan flew to Africa and landed in SÃ£o TomÃ© 
E              B             C#m           G#m 
He saw their flag with green, yellow, red, and black 
E              B             C#m           G#m 
He learned that they were once a Portuguese colony 
E              B             C#m           G#m 
And that their star symbolized hope for democracy 

(Chorus)

Verse 3:
E              B             C#m           G#m 
Jordan then went to Asia and visited Bahrain 
E              B             C#m           G#m 
He saw their flag with white and red serrated stripes 
E              B             C#m           G#m 
He learned that they were an island nation in the Gulf 
E              B             C#m           G#m 
And that their teeth represented their five pillars of Islam 

(Chorus)

Verse 4:
E              B             C # m         G # m  
Jordan finally reached Oceania and stopped by Samoa  
E               B            C # m         G # m  
He saw their flag with blue , red , white , and a cross  
E               B            C # m         G # m  
He learned that they were one of the first Polynesian states  
E               B            C # m         G # m  
And that their colors stood for freedom , courage , faith , and love  

(Chorus)

Bridge:
C # m          A            E            F # m  
But Jordan felt something was missing in his life  
C # m          A            E            F # m  
He had seen so many flags but he had no one to share them with  
C # m          A            E            F # m  
Then he met Crystal , a girl who loved crystal caves   
C # m          A            E            
She showed him her collection of crystals from different places  

Verse 5:
B               F #          AbM7         EbM7   
They fell in love at first sight and decided to elope   
B               F #          AbM7         EbM7   
They got married in a crystal cave with Elon Musk as their witness   
B               F #          AbM7         EbM7   
They moved to Mars where they met some friendly elves   
B               F #          AbM7         
They lived happily ever after with their flags on their shelves   

Outro:
EbM7          F #
Flags of the world , flags of the world    
EbM7          F #
Show me your colors , shapes , and symbols    
EbM7          F #
Flags of the world , flags of the world    
EbM7          
Tell me your stories , secrets , and dreams    
```
