Here is the song I composed for you. I hope you like it!

Bm   G    D    A
I've always loved the flags of the world
Bm   G    D    A
They tell a story of each nation's soul
Bm   G    D    A
Some are simple, some are complex
Bm   G    D    A
But they all have something to express

D     G     Bm     F#
Like Bhutan, with its dragon so fierce
D     G     Bm     F#
Or Guyana, with its golden arrowhead
D     G     Bm     F#
Or Eritrea, with its olive branch of peace
D     G     Bm     F#
They all have colors, shapes, and symbols that make them unique

Bm   D    G    Em
But there's one flag that caught my eye
Bm   D    G    Em
The one that belongs to a boy named Jordan
Bm   D    G    Em 
He's not a country, but he has a story to tell 
Bm   D    G    Em 
About his relationship with giants, Chernobyl, and Post-it notes

D      A      Bm      G 
He met a giant when he was just a kid 
D      A      Bm      G 
He was scared at first, but then they became friends 
D      A      Bm      G 
They traveled the world together, seeing different flags 
D      A      Bm      G 
But then one day, they had to say goodbye 

G       Em       Bm       F#  
The giant had to go back to his home in Chernobyl 
G       Em       Bm       F#  
He said he was sorry, but he had no choice 
G       Em       Bm       F#  
He gave Jordan a Post-it note with his name on it 
G       Em       Bm       F#  
And told him to remember him always 

Bm   D    G    Em   
Jordan kept the note in his pocket for years 
Bm   D    G    Em   
He never forgot his giant friend or their adventures 
Bm   D    G    Em   
He grew up to be a flag designer and an artist 
Bm   D    G    Em   
And he made a flag for himself and his memories 

D        A        Bm        G  
His flag was blue like the sky they flew in 
D        A        Bm        G  
It had a yellow star for their friendship that shone bright 
D        A        Bm        G  
It had a red stripe for the blood they shed in Chernobyl 
D        A        Bm        G  
And it had a Post-it note in the corner with the giant's name 

G         Em         Bm         F#    
That's how Jordan made his own flag of the world 
G         Em         B
