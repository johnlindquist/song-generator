Here is a song I wrote for you. I hope you like it. ðŸ˜Š

## The Wizard of Oz and The Brooklyn Bridge

Verse 1:
C#m    E     F#
Dorothy was a girl from Kansas
C#m    E     F#
She had a dog named Toto too
C#m    E     F#
One day a twister came and took them
C#m    E     F#
To a land of witches and ruby shoes

Chorus:
B      E     G#m    F#
She wanted to go back home
B      E     G#m    F#
But she had to follow the road
B      E     G#m    F#
Made of yellow bricks and stones
B      E     G#m    F#
To the Emerald City where the wizard knows

Verse 2:
C#m    E     F#
Along the way she met some friends
C#m    E     F#
A scarecrow, a tin man and a lion
C#m    E     F#
They had their troubles and their fears
C#m    E     F#
But they also had their hearts' desires

Chorus:
B      E     G#m    F#
They wanted to get what they lacked
B      E     G#m    F#
But they had to face some foes
B      E     G#m    F#
Flying monkeys and an evil witch
B      E     G#m    F#
Who wanted the slippers that Dorothy chose

Bridge:
G       A       B       A 
But they made it to the city 
G       A       B       A 
And they saw the wizard's face 
G       A       B       A 
He was just a man behind a curtain 
G       A       B       A 
With a balloon and a suitcase 

Verse 3:
C#m    E     F#
He said he could help them all
C#m    E     F#
But they had to do one more thing
C#m    E     F#
Bring him the broomstick of the witch
C#m    E     F#
And he would grant them everything

Chorus:
B      E     G#m    F#
They agreed to take the task
B      E     G#m    F#
But they didn't know how to go
B      E     G#m    F#
Then they saw a bridge in the distance
B      E        G        D  
It was made of steel and cables 

Verse 4:
C        Em   Am   D  
It was the Brooklyn Bridge 
C        Em   Am   D  
It crossed over the river 
C        Em   Am   D  
They decided to take a chance 
C        Em   Am   D  
And walk across it together 

Chorus:
G      C         Em         D  
They found out it was a shortcut 
G      C         Em         D  
To the castle of the witch 
G      C         Em         D  
They fought her with some water 
G          C          Em          D  
And they got her broomstick 

Verse 5:
F        Am   C   G   
They went back to the wizard 
F        Am   C   G   
And they gave him what he asked 
F        Am   C   G   
He gave them some tokens of his wisdom 
F            Am           C           Bb   
And he said he would take Dorothy back 

Chorus: (key change)
Eb             Ab             C             Bb   
But then he flew away in his balloon 
Eb             Ab             C             Bb   
And left Dorothy alone with her friends 
Eb             Ab             C             Bb   
She thought she would never see her home again 
Eb              Ab              Db              Eb   
Until she learned she had it in her all along 

Outro: (repeat chorus chords)
All you have to do is click your heels three times And say there's no place like home There's no place like home There's no place like home And then you'll wake up in your bed With Toto by your side And everything will be alright The end.
