Sure, I can try to write lyrics and chords to a song about a keyboard cleaner and the Indian Ocean in the style of They Might be Giants. Here is what I came up with:

```
D       Bm      G       F#
He was a keyboard cleaner by day
D       Bm      G       F#
But he had a secret dream
D       Bm      G       F#
He wanted to sail across the sea
D       Bm      G       F#
And explore the Indian Ocean

G       D       Em      C
But he didn't have a boat or a crew
G       D       Em      C
He only had his coffee mug and his trash can
G       D       Em      C
So he decided to build his own ship
G       D       Em      C
Out of his keyboard cleaning supplies

D               G        Em        C
He called it The Keyboard Cleaner's Dream (Dream)
D               G        Em        C
He said it was the best thing he'd ever seen (Seen)
D               G        Em        C
He packed his bags and set off for adventure (Ture)
D               G        Em        C
He said goodbye to his keyboard cleaner friends (Friends)

A           F#m     E           D 
He sailed for days and nights on end 
A           F#m     E           D 
He faced storms and pirates and sharks 
A           F#m     E           D 
But he never gave up on his quest 
A           F#m     E           D 
To see the wonders of the Indian Ocean 

B            E         F#         D#
He saw coral reefs and islands and whales 
B            E         F#         D#
He met new people and cultures and tales 
B            E         F#         D#
He learned new things and grew as a person 
B            E         F#         D#
He felt alive in the Indian Ocean 

E               A        F#        D#
And he sang The Keyboard Cleaner's Dream (Dream) 
E               A        F#        D#
And he said it was the best thing he'd ever seen (Seen) 
E               A        F#        D#
And he thanked his coffee mug and his trash can (Can) 
E               A        F#        D#
And he hugged his keyboard cleaner friends (Friends) 

C          Am    G          Am    C          Am    G          Am    
The Keyboard Cleaner's Dream, The Keyboard Cleaner's Dream  
C          Am    G          Am    C          Am    G          Am    
The Keyboard Cleaner's Dream, The Keyboard Cleaner's Dream
