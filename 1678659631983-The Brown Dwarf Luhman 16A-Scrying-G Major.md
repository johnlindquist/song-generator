Here is the song I composed for you:

Verse 1:
C    D    Em   Bm
Jordan loves geography
C    D    Em   Bm
He knows every country and sea
C    D    Em   Bm
He has a map on his bedroom wall
C    D    Em   Bm
And he can name the capitals

Chorus:
G     E     C     D
But he dreams of something more
G     E     C     D
A place he's never seen before
G     E     C     D
A world beyond the Milky Way
G     E     C     D 
Where he can go and play

Verse 2:
C    D    Em   Bm 
Jordan likes to scry at night 
C    D    Em   Bm 
He uses a crystal ball for sight 
C    D    Em   Bm 
He sees a star that's very far 
C    D    Em   Bm 
It's called Luhman 16A 

Chorus:
G     E     C     D 
But he dreams of something more 
G     E     C     D 
A place he's never seen before 
G     E     C     D 
A world beyond the Milky Way 
G      E      C      D  
Where he can go and play 

Bridge:
Am       G       F        G  
So he makes a wish upon that star  
Am       G       F        G  
Hoping it will take him very far  
Am       G       F        G  
Suddenly he feels a strange sensation  
Am       G       F        G  
He's flying through the sky in elation  

Verse 3:  
C      D      Em      Bm   
Jordan lands on a planet blue  
C      D      Em      Bm   
He sees a flag with red and white hues  
C      D      Em      Bm   
He meets some friendly aliens there  
C      D      Em      Bm   
They tell him it's called San Marino  

Chorus:  
G       E       C       D   
Now he's living his dream and more  
G       E       C       D   
He's exploring a place he's never seen before  
G       E       C       D   
A world beyond the Milky Way  
G        E        C        D    
Where he can go and play  

Outro:  
Em         Am         G          Am    
Jordan is happy in his new home    
Em         Am         G          Am    
He loves San Marino and its dome    
Em         Am         G          Am    
He still remembers his old life     
Em         Am         G          Am     
But he wouldn't trade it for the world  

End on G chord.
