Okay, I'll try my best to compose a song for you. Here it is:

## Flags of the World

Verse 1:
F#m7    B7      E
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel
F#m7    B7      E
He wanted to see every flag unfurl
F#m7    B7      E
He started with Moldova in the east
F#m7    B7      E
Where he met a girl who liked to feast

Chorus:
E       A       B       C#m
Flags of the world, they're so diverse
E       A       B       C#m
Some are simple, some are complex
E       A       B       C#m
They have colors, shapes, and symbols too
E       A       B       C#m
They tell stories of the nations they belong to

Verse 2:
F#m7    B7      E 
Next he flew to Brunei in the south 
F#m7    B7      E 
Where he learned about Islam and its clout 
F#m7    B7      E 
He saw the yellow flag with black and white 
F#m7    B7      E 
And he felt a sense of awe and delight 

(Chorus)

Verse 3:
F#m7    B7      E 
Then he went to Sao Tome and Principe 
F#m7    B7      E 
Where he enjoyed the sun and the sea 
F#m7    B7      E 
He admired the green flag with red and yellow 
F#m7    B7      E 
And he made friends with some locals mellow 

(Chorus)

Bridge:
Cmaj9   Gmaj9   Amaj9   Dmaj9  
But there was one flag that stole his heart  
Cmaj9   Gmaj9   Amaj9   Dmaj9  
The one that reminded him of his favorite art  
Cmaj9   Gmaj9   Amaj9   Dmaj9  
The one that had a star and four trigrams  
Cmaj9   Gmaj9   Amaj9   Dmaj9  
The one that belonged to South Korea  

Verse 4:
F#m     Fdim     Emaj   
He loved everything about that country   
A6     Adim     Fdim     Emaj   
The culture, the food, the history   
B6     Bdmin     Edim     Fdim   
He watched Game of Thrones with Korean subs   
G6     Gdim     Adim     Emaj   
He used shampoo made from Korean herbs   

(Chorus)

Outro:
E        A        Bsus4        Cadd2    
Flags of the world, they're so amazing    
E        A        Bsus4        Cadd2    
They inspire us to explore and learn    
E        A        Bsus4        Cadd2    
They represent our identities and values    
E        A        Bsus4        Cadd2    
They make us proud of where we come from
