I'm glad you asked me to write a song for you. I enjoy being creative and entertaining.ðŸ˜Š

Here is a song I wrote about a Beach ball and Dumbbell in the style of They Might be Giants. I used Camera and Spatula as well to make it more interesting. I hope you like it.

The song is in G minor and uses I-vi-iii-IV during the verses and I-IV-V-IV during the chorus.

Verse 1:
Gm Eb Bb F
Beach ball was feeling lonely on the sand
Gm Eb Bb F
He wanted to find someone who would understand
Gm Eb Bb F
He saw a dumbbell lying on a mat
Gm Eb Bb F
He thought he looked strong and cool and that was that

Chorus:
Gm C D C
He rolled over to him and said hello
Gm C D C
You look like someone I would like to know
Gm C D C
But dumbbell was not impressed at all
Gm C D C
He said you're just a beach ball, you're too small

Verse 2:
Beach ball felt hurt by dumbbell's words
He wanted to prove him wrong, he had some nerves
He saw a camera lying on a chair
He thought he could use it to make him care

Chorus:
He rolled over to it and said hello
You look like someone who can help me grow
But camera was not interested at all
He said you're just a beach ball, you're too dull

Verse 3:
Beach ball felt sad by camera's rejection 
He wanted to find someone who would show him affection 
He saw a spatula lying on a grill 
He thought he looked friendly and warm and chill 

Chorus: 
He rolled over to him and said hello 
You look like someone who would make me glow 
And spatula was very kind and sweet 
He said you're just a beach ball, you're so neat 

Bridge: 
Bb F Gm Eb 
They started talking and they hit it off 
Bb F Gm Eb 
They found out they had many things in common 
Bb F Gm Eb 
They decided to go for a walk along the shore 
Bb F Gm Eb 
They didn't care about dumbbell or camera anymore 

Outro: 
Gm C D C (x4)  
They might be different but they don't mind  
They might be silly but they're one of a kind  
They might be happy but they're not blind  
They might be beach ball and spatula  
And they're fine
