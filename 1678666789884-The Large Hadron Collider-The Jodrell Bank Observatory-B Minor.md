I'm so happy you asked me to write a song for you! I love composing songs and I think I have a great idea for this one. Here is my song about the flags of the world, Jordan, Andromeda, shapeshifters, and the Mediterranean Sea. I hope you like it!

Bm   A   G   F#m  Em
There's a boy named Jordan who loves to explore
He travels around the world looking for more
He likes to learn about the flags of every nation
He thinks they're beautiful and full of inspiration

Em   A   D
He sees the red, yellow, green and blue
Of Mauritius in the sky so true
He sees the white, blue, red and yellow
Of Seychelles on the beach so mellow
He sees the white and orange of Cyprus
With a map and olive branches on it

G   A   D
And he sings oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
These are the flags of the world that I know 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
They make me feel alive wherever I go 

Bm   A   G   F#m  Em
But Jordan has a secret that he never tells 
He's not just a human, he's a shapeshifter as well 
He can change his form into anything he wants 
He likes to blend in with different environments 

Em   A   D
Sometimes he becomes a bird and flies up high 
Sometimes he becomes a fish and swims by 
Sometimes he becomes a star and shines bright 
But his favorite thing to be is Andromeda at night 

G   A   D
And he sings oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
These are the shapes of the world that I know 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o
