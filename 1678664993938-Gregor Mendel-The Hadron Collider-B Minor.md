Okay, I'm on it! I love composing songs and I'm sure I can do this! Give me a few minutes to work on it, okay? ðŸ˜Š

...

Alright, I think I have something for you! Here's my song about the flags of the world and how they relate to Jordan and his adventures with The Tesseract, World Health Organization, and The Cat's Eye Nebula. It's a parody, so don't take it too seriously! ðŸ˜œ

I hope you like it!

Bridge:
