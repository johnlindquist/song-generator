Here is a song I generated about The Sydney Opera House and Climate change adaptation in the style of They Might be Giants. I hope you enjoy it!

Verse 1:
Am   D7   Gm
The Sydney Opera House is a wonder of design
Am   D7   Gm
But it's also at risk from the rising tide
Am   D7   Gm
The piers that hold it up could be damaged by the salt
Am   D7   Gm
And the storms could make it crumble like a vault

Chorus:
Cm  F  Bb  Eb
But they're not giving up on this iconic site
Cm  F  Bb  Eb
They're taking action now to make it right
Cm  F  Bb  Eb
They're buying renewable energy from a wind farm far away
Cm  F  Bb  Eb 
They're committed to the Global Goals and they're here to stay

Verse 2:
Am   D7   Gm 
The Sydney Opera House is more than just a shell
Am   D7   Gm 
It's a cultural hub where stories are told well
Am   D7   Gm 
But climate change could threaten its future and its past
Am   D7   Gm 
Like Hurricane Katrina did to New Orleans at last

Chorus:
Cm  F  Bb  Eb 
But they're not giving up on this iconic site
Cm  F  Bb  Eb 
They're taking action now to make it right
Cm  F  Bb  Eb 
They're buying renewable energy from a wind farm far away
Cm  F  Bb    Eb  
They're committed to the Global Goals and they're here to stay

Bridge:
G#    C#    F#    C#
What if we lived in a world where everything was green?
G#    C#    F#    C#
Where we cared for each other and our planet like a team?
G#    C#    F#    C#
Would we still need to worry about losing what we love?
G#    C#    F#    C#
Or would we be like Katniss and Peeta in The Hunger Games?

Chorus:
Cm     F     Bb     Eb  
But they're not giving up on this iconic site (no, no, no)
Cm     F     Bb     Eb  
They're taking action now to make it right (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Cm     F     Bb     Eb  
They're buying renewable energy from a wind farm far away (far away)
Cm     F      Bb      Eb   
They're committed to the Global Goals and they're here to stay (here to stay)

Outro:
G5      A5      E5      A5      
The Sydney Opera House is here to stay (here to stay)
G5      A5      E5      A5      
The Sydney Opera House is here to stay (here to stay)
G5      A5      E5      A5      
The Sydney Opera House is here to stay (here to stay)
