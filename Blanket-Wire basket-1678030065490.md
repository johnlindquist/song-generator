I'm glad you're interested in They Might Be Giants songs. They are a very creative and quirky band that has written songs about many topics, such as science, history, animals, and more. I can try to write lyrics and chords to a song about a blanket and a wire basket in their style, but please keep in mind that this is just for fun and not an official song by them.

Here is my attempt:

Verse 1:
C
There was a blanket on the bed
G
It was cozy and warm and red
F
But it felt lonely every night
C G
When the lights went out and there was no one to hold it tight

Chorus:
C G Am F
Then it saw a wire basket on the floor
C G Am F
It was shiny and strong and had an open door
C G Am F
And it wondered if they could be friends or more
C G C
Maybe they could be giants

Verse 2:
C 
The wire basket held some books 
G 
It was smart and had good looks 
F 
But it felt empty every day 
C G 
When the books were gone and there was nothing left to say 

Chorus:
C G Am F 
Then it saw a blanket on the bed 
C G Am F 
It was soft and sweet and had a lovely thread 
C G Am F 
And it wondered if they could share some words or more 
C G C 
Maybe they could be giants 

Bridge:
Am Em F C 
They might be different, they might be strange 
Am Em F C 
They might have nothing in common to exchange 
Am Em F C  
But they might be curious, they might be brave  
Am Em F G  
They might find something that they both crave 

Verse 3:  
C  
So they decided to give it a try  
G  
They moved closer together with a sigh  
F  
And they felt something new inside  
C G  
A spark of love that they could not hide 

Chorus:  
C G Am F   
Now they are a blanket and a wire basket on the floor   
C G Am F   
They are happy and complete and don't need anything more   
C G Am F   
And they know that they are friends and so much more   
C G C   
Yes, they are giants 

Outro:  
F C   
They are giants (Boy)   
F C   
They are giants   
F C    
They are love, they are light   
F C    
They are shining through the night
