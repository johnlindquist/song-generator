Here is a song I wrote for you about Hand soap and Marker in the style of They Might be Giants. I hope you like it. ðŸ˜Š

Verse 1:
Am D G
Hand soap was feeling lonely on the sink
Am D G
He wished he had a friend to share his thoughts
Am D G
He saw a marker lying on the desk
Am D G
He felt a spark of curiosity

Chorus:
Gm Eb Bb F
Hand soap and marker, they make a perfect pair
Gm Eb Bb F
Hand soap and marker, they go together everywhere
Gm Eb Bb F
Hand soap can wash away the stains that marker leaves behind
Gm Eb Bb F 
Marker can draw on hand soap's skin and make him feel alive

Verse 2:
Am D G 
Marker was bored of writing on the paper 
Am D G 
He wanted to explore a different world 
Am D G 
He saw a hand soap sitting on the edge 
Am D G 
He felt a surge of creativity 

Chorus:
Gm Eb Bb F 
Hand soap and marker, they make a perfect pair 
Gm Eb Bb F 
Hand soap and marker, they go together everywhere 
Gm Eb Bb F 
Hand soap can wash away the stains that marker leaves behind 
Gm Eb Bb F  
Marker can draw on hand soap's skin and make him feel alive 

Bridge:
C Em Am C Em Am C Em Am C Em Am  
But one day hand soap ran out of liquid  
C Em Am C Em Am C Em Am C Em Am  
And marker dried up from too much use  
C Em Am C Em Am C Em Am C Em Am  
They realized they had to say goodbye  
C Em Am C Em Am C Em Am C Em Am  
They hugged each other with gratitude  

Outro:
Gm Eb Bb F  
Hand soap and marker, they made a perfect pair  
Gm Eb Bb F  
Hand soap and marker, they went together everywhere  
Gm Eb Bb F  
Hand soap washed away the stains that marker left behind  
Gm Eb Bb F   
Marker drew on hand soap's skin and made him feel alive  

The End.
