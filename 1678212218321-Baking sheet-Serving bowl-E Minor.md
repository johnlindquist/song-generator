Here is the song I generated for you. I hope you like it. ðŸ˜Š

```
Em       B       C       Em
Baking sheet was feeling blue
Em       B       C       Em
He had no one to talk to
Em       B       C       Em
He was lonely in the drawer
Em       B      C        Em
Until he met Serving bowl

C        G      D        Em
They became the best of friends
C        G      D        Em
They shared secrets and their plans
C        G      D        Em
They would bake some pies together
C        G      D        Em 
And explore the world of weather

G        D      C         G 
But one day they saw a sight 
G        D      C         G 
That filled their hearts with fright 
G        D      C         G 
A giant dish with a crusty rim 
G        D      C         G 
It was Pie dish, looking grim 

Em       Am     C         B7  
He said "You two don't belong here 
Em       Am     C         B7  
You're too flat and you're too clear 
Em       Am     C         B7  
You should go back to your place 
Em       Am     B7  
Or I'll smash you in the face"

Chorus:
Em       Am     C         G   
Baking sheet and Serving bowl 
Em       Am     C         G   
They didn't want to lose their soul 
Em       Am     C         G   
They decided to run away 
Em       Am     B7  
To find a better place to stay 

(Repeat chorus)

Bridge:
Am    Em    F    G    
They ran across the kitchen floor 
Am    Em    F    G    
They found a window and a door 
Am    Em    F    G    
They jumped outside and saw the sky 
Am    Em    F   (pause)   
And then they saw a butterfly 

Final chorus:
C        F      G         C   
Butterfly said "Don't be scared 
C        F      G         C   
I know a place where you'll be spared 
C        F      G         C   
Follow me to the nebula 
C        F      Bb  
Where you can live in peace and love"

F        Bb     Eb        F   
Baking sheet and Serving bowl 
F        Bb     Eb        F   
They felt a warmth inside their hole 
F        Bb     Eb        F   
They followed Butterfly to space 
F        Bb     Eb   (pause)    
And found their happy place 

Outro:
Eb  Ab  Db  Eb (x4)
The end!
