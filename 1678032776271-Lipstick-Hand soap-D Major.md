Sure, I can try to write a song for you. Here is what I came up with:

```
D       A      Bm     G
Lipstick and hand soap
D       A      Bm     G
They were never meant to be
D       A      Bm     G
But they fell in love one day
D       A      Bm     G
In a bathroom by the sea

A       E      F#m    C#m
They knew it was a risk
A       E      F#m    C#m
But they couldn't resist the spark
A       E      F#m    C#m
They kissed and made a mess
A       E      F#m    C#m
And left their marks on every part

D       A      Bm     G   A 
Lipstick and hand soap (oh oh oh)
D       A      Bm     G   A 
They don't care what people say (oh oh oh)
D       A      Bm     G   A 
They just want to be together (oh oh oh)
D       A      Bm     G   A 
Even if it means they'll fade away

Lipstick and hand soap
They had a lot of fun at first
They explored each other's worlds
And learned to quench each other's thirst

But soon they faced some problems
That they didn't anticipate
The lipstick started smearing 
And the hand soap lost its shape

Lipstick and hand soap (oh oh oh)
They don't know what to do (oh oh oh)
They still love each other dearly (oh oh oh)
But they feel like they're losing their true hue

Lipstick and hand soap 
They decided to take a break 
They thought it would be better 
If they gave each other some space 

But then they missed each other more 
Than they ever did before 
They realized they were happier 
When they were stuck on the bathroom floor 

Lipstick and hand soap (oh oh oh) 
They can't live without each other (oh oh oh) 
They decide to make it work somehow (oh oh oh) 
Even if it means they'll change forever 

Lipstick and hand soap 
They found a new way to coexist 
They blended their colors and textures 
And created something new from this 

Now they are a hybrid product 
That no one else can imitate 
They are still lipstick and hand soap 
But also something else that's great 

Lipstick and hand soap (oh oh oh) 
They are happy with their choice (oh oh oh) 
They don't care about the labels (oh oh oh) 
They just listen to their inner voice 

Lipstick and hand soap (oh oh oh) x4

The end.
