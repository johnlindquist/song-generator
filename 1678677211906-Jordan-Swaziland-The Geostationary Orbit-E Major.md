Wow, that's quite a challenge! But I love composing songs, so I'll give it my best shot. Here's what I came up with:

# The Adventures of Jordan

E B A
Jordan was an 11-year-old boy who loved to explore
E B A
He dreamed of seeing places he had never seen before
E B A
He packed his boots and passport and he boarded a plane
E B A
He didn't know where he was going but he didn't care

C#m G#m A B
He was looking for adventure, he was looking for some fun
C#m G#m A B
He wanted to see the world and all that it had done
C#m G#m A B 
He didn't need a reason, he didn't need a plan
C#m G#m A E 
He just wanted to be Jordan, the traveling man

E B A 
His first stop was Swaziland, a small country in Africa
E B A 
He met some friendly people who taught him how to dance
E B A 
They showed him their traditions and their culture and their art
E B A 
He learned a lot from them and they touched his heart

(Chorus)

E B A 
His next stop was Malta, an island in the sea
E B A 
He saw some ancient temples and some stunning scenery
E B A 
He tasted their cuisine and he learned some history
E B A 
He felt like he was part of their family

(Chorus)

E B A 
His third stop was Vatican City, the smallest state in the world
E B A 
He marveled at the architecture and the paintings on the wall
E B A 
He witnessed a papal blessing and he prayed in St. Peter's Square
E B A 
He felt a sense of peace and wonder there

(Chorus)

A E F#m D E F#
But then something happened that changed his life forever (forever)
A E F#m D E F#
He got an invitation that he couldn't refuse (refuse)
A E F#m D E F#
It said "Dear Jordan, we have a special offer for you (for you)
A E F#m D E F#
We want you to join us on a trip to the geostationary orbit"

G D C G D C G D C G D C G D C G D C G D C 

(Bridge)

G D C  
The geostationary orbit is where satellites go round and round (round and round)
G D C  
It's 22,000 miles above the ground (above the ground)
G D C  
It's where you can see the whole Earth from one spot (from one spot)
G D C  
It's where you can feel like you're on top of the world (on top of the world)

(Bridge)

G D C  
Jordan couldn't believe it, he thought it was too good to be true (true)
G D C  
But he decided to take a chance and see what they would do (do)
G D C  
They gave him a spacesuit and a helmet and they put him on a rocket (rocket)
G D C  
They said "Don't worry Jordan, you're going to love it" (love it)

(Bridge)

G D C  
The rocket took off with a blast and Jordan felt a thrill (thrill)
G D C  
He saw the Earth getting smaller as they climbed up higher still (still)
G D C  
They reached the orbit in no time and Jordan gasped in awe (awe)
G D C  
He saw the most amazing sight that he ever saw

(Chorus x2)

C#m G#m A B   
He saw adventure, he saw fun, he saw beauty everywhere   
C#m G#m A B   
He saw wonders, he saw miracles, he saw things beyond compare   
C#m G#m A B   
He found his reason, he found his plan, he found his destiny   
C#m G#m A E   
And now Jordan is happy as can be   

(Finale)   

A E F
