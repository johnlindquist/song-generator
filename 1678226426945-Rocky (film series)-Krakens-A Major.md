Verse 1:
A         F#m      D        E
Rocky was a boxer with a dream
A         F#m      D        E
He wanted to be the best in the ring
A         F#m      D        E
But he had a rival he couldn't beat
A         F#m      D        E
A giant squid with tentacles and teeth

Chorus:
A       D       E       D
He's the Kraken, he's the Kraken
A       D       E       D
He's the monster of the sea
A       D       E       D
He's the Kraken, he's the Kraken
A       D       E     A 
And he's coming after me

Verse 2:
A         F#m      D        E
Rocky trained hard every day and night
A         F#m      D        E
He punched some meat and ran up some flights
A         F#m      D        E 
He got some help from his old friend Mick 
A         F#m      D        E 
Who gave him a toaster for a gift

Chorus:
A       D       E       D 
He's the Kraken, he's the Kraken 
A       D       E       D 
He's the monster of the sea 
A       D       E       D 
He's the Kraken, he's the Kraken 
A       D       E     A  
And he's coming after me 

Bridge:
F#m          C#m    Bm    C#
Then one day Rocky got a chance 
F#m          C#m    Bm    C#
To fight the Kraken in advance 
F#m          C#m    Bm    C#
He took his toaster to the shore 
F#m          C#m    B
