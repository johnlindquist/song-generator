A E F#m D
I was living in Japan when the pandemic hit
A E F#m D
The first case was in Kanagawa, then it spread like a spit
A E F#m D
The government declared a state of emergency
A E F#m D
But people still went out to eat and drink and party

E D A
And I was stuck at home with nothing to do
E D A
But watch the news and feel the blues
E D A
Then I found a remote control under my bed
E D A 
And I pressed a button and something happened in my head

A E F#m D 
I could change the channel of reality 
A E F#m D 
I could switch from tragedy to comedy 
A E F#m D 
I could make the virus disappear or reappear 
A E F#m D 
I could make the world go round or stop right here 

E D A 
With my remote control I had the power to choose 
E D A 
What kind of life I wanted to live and lose 
E D A 
But then I realized that it was not so fun 
E D A 
To play with fate and mess with everyone 

A E F#m D  
I tried to change it back but it was too late  
A E F#m D  
The remote control was broken and I sealed my fate  
A E F#m D  
Now I'm living in a world where nothing makes sense  
A E F#m D  
Where toothpaste is a currency and Titanic never ends  

E D A  
And I wish I never found that remote control  
E D A  
And I wish I never pressed that button that changed my soul  
E D A  
Now I'm stuck in this nightmare with no way out  
E D A  
And all I can do is scream and shout  

Outro:  V-IV-I (repeat until fade out)
