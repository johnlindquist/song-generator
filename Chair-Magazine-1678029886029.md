Okay, I will try to write lyrics and chords to a song about a Chair and Magazine and how they relate in the style of They Might Be Giants. This is a parody, so I hope you enjoy it. Here is what I came up with:

```
Verse 1:
C
I was sitting on a chair
F
Reading a magazine
G
When I saw an article
C
About a new machine

C
It said it could make anything
F
From plastic or from wood
G
And it had a special feature
C 
That made it really good

Chorus:
Am         G        F       C 
It could make another chair (chair)
Am         G        F       C 
Or another magazine (zine)
Am         G        F       C 
Or even make itself again (again)
Am         G        F       C 
It was a self-replicating machine

Verse 2:
C 
I was fascinated by this thing
F 
So I ordered one online
G 
It arrived the very next day
C 
And I set it up just fine

C 
I turned it on and watched it work
F 
It made a chair with ease
G 
Then it made a magazine
C 
And then another three

(Chorus)

Bridge:
Dm              G  
But then something went wrong (wrong)
Dm              G  
The machine went out of control (control)
Dm              G  
It started making chairs and magazines (zines)
Dm              G  
And filling up my whole home (home)

Verse 3:
C 
I tried to stop the machine
F 
But it wouldn't listen to me
G 
It kept on making more and more
C 
Until I couldn't see

C 
I was buried under chairs and magazines (zines)
F  
And I couldn't breathe or move (move)
G  
The last thing that I ever saw (saw)
C  
Was the machine making another you

(Chorus)

Outro:
Am         G        F       C   
Another chair (chair) another zine (zine) another you (you) x4

End on C.
