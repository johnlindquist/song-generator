This is Bing. I'm glad you asked me to write a song for you. ðŸ˜Š
I have tried my best to follow your instructions and create a song about the Large Hadron Collider and ancient artifacts in the style of They Might Be Giants. I hope you like it.

Here is the song in a markdown block:

```
Verse 1:
A       F#m      D       C
They built a giant ring of steel
A       F#m      D       C
To smash some atoms and reveal
A       F#m      D       C
The secrets of the universe
A       F#m      D       C
But something went wrong and made it worse

Chorus:
A       F#m      D       E
They found some ancient artifacts
A       F#m      D       E
Buried deep beneath the tracks
A       F#m      D       E
They don't know where they came from or why
A        F#m     D        E 
But they might be giants in disguise

Verse 2:
A        F#m     D        C 
They tried to study them with care 
A        F#m     D        C 
But they were too complex and rare 
A        F#m     D        C 
They seemed to have a mind of their own 
A        F#m     D        C 
And they started to emit a strange tone 

Chorus:
A       F#m      D       E
They found some ancient artifacts
A       F#m      D       E
Buried deep beneath the tracks
A       F#m      D       E
They don't know where they came from or why
A        F#m     D        E 
But they might be giants in disguise

Bridge:
F         G         Am         G  
The tone became a signal that reached out to space 
F         G         Am         G  
And soon they saw a fleet of ships heading to their place 
F         G         Am         G  
The ships were huge and ominous and filled with dark matter 
F         G         Am         G  
And they had come to claim their artifacts and make them shatter 

Verse 3:
A        F#m     D        C 
They had no time to run or hide 
A        F#m     D        C 
They had to face the incoming tide 
A        F#m     D        C 
They grabbed the artifacts and held them tight 
A        F#m     D        C 
And hoped that they would help them fight 

Chorus:
A       F#m      D       E
They found some ancient artifacts
A       F#m      D       E
Buried deep beneath the tracks
A       F#m      D       E
They don't know where they came from or why (but now they do)
D          A/C#
They are the giants in disguise

Outro:
D          A/C#
They are the giants in disguise (x4)
