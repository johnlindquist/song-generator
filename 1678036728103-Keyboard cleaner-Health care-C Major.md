I'm glad you asked me to write a song about keyboard cleaner and health care in the style of They Might Be Giants. I enjoy their quirky and catchy songs. Here is my attempt at creating a parody song for you. I hope you like it.

Dm7   G7   Cmaj7
I was working on my laptop late one night
Dm7   G7   Cmaj7
When I noticed that my keys were not so bright
Dm7   G7   Cmaj7
They were sticky and greasy and full of crumbs
Dm7   G7   Cmaj7
So I decided to give them a little scrub

C    F    G    F
But I didn't have any keyboard cleaner 
C    F    G    F
So I used some rubbing alcohol instead 
C    F    G    F
And I didn't realize what I was doing 
C    F    G    F
Until I saw that my keyboard was dead

G     Am     Bb     Am   
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no 
G     Am     Bb     Am   
What have I done? What have I done? 
G     Am     Bb     Am   
I killed my keyboard with alcohol 
G     Am     Bb     Am   
Now I need a new one

Dm7   G7   Cmaj7
I went online to look for a replacement 
Dm7   G7   Cmaj7
But they were all too expensive or out of stock 
Dm7   G7   Cmaj7
Then I saw an ad for a cheap solution 
Dm7   G7   Cmaj7
It said "Keyboard Cleaner for only ten bucks"

C    F    G    F
But it wasn't really keyboard cleaner 
C    F    G    F
It was just a can of compressed air 
C    F    G    F
And it didn't do anything for my keyboard 
C    F    G    F
Except make it fly up in the air

G     Am     Bb     Am   
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no 
G     Am     Bb     Am   
What have I done? What have I done? 
G     Am     Bb     Am   
I blew up my keyboard with air 
G     Am      Bb      A  
Now it's gone forever

Dm9  A13  Dmaj9  
I called up my insurance company  
Dm9  A13  Dmaj9  
To see if they would cover the damage  
Dm9  A13  Dmaj9  
But they said that keyboards are not included  
Dm9  A13  Dmaj9  
In their health care plan package  

A      D      E      D    
But they offered me a consolation prize  
A      D      E      D    
They said they would send me a free gift card  
A      D      E      D    
To Google Play where I could download some songs  
A      D      E      D    
By They Might Be Giants who are super cool  

E       Fsus2       Abdim       Fsus2     
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, oh yes  
E       Fsus2       Abdim       Fsus2     
What have they done? What have they done?  
E       Fsus2       Abdim       Fsus2     
They made me happy with music  
E       Fsus2        Abdim        Fsus2     
Now I don't need a keyboard
