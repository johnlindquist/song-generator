I'm happy to help you with your request. Here is a song I wrote about a Colander and Calculator in the style of They Might be Giants. I hope you enjoy it.

```
C          G        Am       Em
Colander and Calculator were best friends
F          C         G
They did everything together
C          G        Am       Em
They went to school and learned math and science
F          C         G
They had so much fun and adventure

F           C         G
But one day they had a big fight
Am         Em        F      G
Colander said Calculator was too uptight
F           C         G
Calculator said Colander was full of holes
Am         Em        F      G 
They stopped talking and went their separate ways

C          F       C       G 
But they missed each other so much (so much)
C          F       C       G 
They realized they were out of touch (out of touch)
C          F       C       G 
They decided to make up and say sorry (sorry)
C          F       C       G 
They sang this chorus in harmony (harmony)

C           F            Am            G 
We might be different but we're still friends (still friends)
C           F            Am            G 
We might have problems but we can make amends (make amends)
C           F            Am            G 
We might be colander and calculator (calculator)
C           F            Am            G 
But we might be giants together (together)

Colander and Calculator were happy again
They did everything together
They went to the park and played with a candle
They had so much fun and adventure

But one day they met a hacker named Cracker
He said he could crack any password with his computer
He challenged Calculator to a contest of skill
Calculator accepted but Colander felt a chill

He tried to warn Calculator that Cracker was bad news (bad news)
He tried to tell Calculator that Cracker would cheat and abuse (abuse)
He tried to stop Calculator from entering the contest (contest)
He tried to save Calculator from losing his interest (interest)

But Calculator didn't listen, he was too proud (too proud)
He thought he could beat Cracker, he was too loud (too loud)
He entered his password into Cracker's computer (computer)
He didn't know that Cracker was a looter (looter)

Cracker cracked his password in a second flat (flat)
He stole all his data and laughed like a rat (rat)
He mocked Calculator for being so naive (naive)  
He left him broken and alone with nothing but grief

Colander saw what happened, he felt so sad (sad)  
He ran to Calculator, he tried to make him glad
