This is a song I composed for you about Jordan and his adventures. I hope you like it!

Verse 1:
G              C
Jordan is a boy who loves geography
Em             Bm
He knows all the flags of every country
G              C
He dreams of traveling around the world
Em             Bm
And seeing all the wonders unfurled

Chorus:
Am             C              D
He wants to go to the Bermuda Triangle
Am             C              D
And find out what makes it so special
Am             C              D
He wants to climb the Mount Everest peak
Am             C              D          G (hold)
And wave the flag of Azerbaijan so unique

Verse 2:
G              C 
Jordan has a map on his bedroom wall
Em             Bm 
He marks all the places he wants to call 
G              C 
He reads all the books he can find 
Em             Bm 
About the cultures and history of mankind 

Chorus:
Am             C              D 
He wants to go to the Bermuda Triangle 
Am             C              D 
And find out what makes it so special 
Am             C              D 
He wants to climb the Mount Everest peak 
Am             C              D          G (hold) 
And wave the flag of Azerbaijan so unique 

Bridge:
Bm            Em            Am            D  
But he knows he can't do it all by himself  
Bm            Em            Am            D  
He needs some friends who share his passion as well  
Bm            Em            Am            D  
So he joins a club at school where they learn and play  
Bm            Em            Am            D (hold)  
And he meets some kids who want to join him someday 

Verse 3:
G              C  
Jordan is a boy who loves geography  
Em             Bm  
He knows all the flags of every country  
G              C  
He dreams of traveling around the world  
Em             Bm  
And seeing all the wonders unfurled  

Chorus: (x2)
Am             C              D  
He wants to go to the Bermuda Triangle  
Am             C              D  
And find out what makes it so special  
Am             C              D  
He wants to climb the Mount Everest peak  
Am             C              D          G (hold)   
And wave the flag of Azerbaijan so unique  

Outro:   
G               Em               Am               G   
Jordan, Jordan, you're amazing   
G               Em               Am               G   
Jordan, Jordan, keep on dreaming
