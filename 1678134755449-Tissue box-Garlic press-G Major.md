Okay, I will try to write a song about a tissue box and a garlic press in the style of They Might Be Giants. Here is what I came up with:

```markdown
Bm   Em   Am   D
Tissue box and garlic press
Bm   Em   Am   D
They were living in distress
Bm   Em   Am   D
Until they met each other one day
Bm   Em   Am   D
And decided to run away

G    C    D
They might be lovers (boy)
G    C    D
They might be lovers 
G    C    D
They might be weird, they might be sweet 
G    C    D
They might be crushing on the street 

Bm   Em   Am   D
Tissue box and garlic press 
Bm   Em   Am   D
They had a lot of things to confess 
Bm   Em   Am   D
Like how they hated their old jobs 
Bm   Em  Am  D  
And how they wanted to join the mobs 

G    C    D 
They might be rebels (boy) 
G    C    D 
They might be rebels 
G    C    D 
They might be brave, they might be bold 
G    C    D  
They might be breaking all the mold 

Em  A  Bm  G  
But then they met a lipstick tube 
Em  A  Bm  G  
Who had a different attitude 
Em  A  Bm  G  
She said she worked for AI marketing 
Em  A  Bm  G  
And she could make them anything 

C     G     A   
She might be lying (girl) 
C     G     A   
She might be lying  
C     G     A   
She might be fake, she might be mean  
C     G     A   
She might be part of a machine 

Bm      Em      Am      D     
Tissue box and garlic press  
Bm      Em      Am      D     
They didn't know what to do next  
Bm      Em      Am      D     
Should they trust her or should they flee?  
Bm      Em      Am      D     
Should they stay or should they leave?  

G       C       D    
They might be giants (boy)    
G       C       D    
They might be giants    
G       C       D    
They might be strong, they might be smart    
G       C       D    
They might be following their heart
