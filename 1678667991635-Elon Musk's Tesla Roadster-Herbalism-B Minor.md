Here is my original song about flags of the world:

Bm  G   A   F#
There's a boy named Jordan who loves flags
He collects them all in his backpacks
He knows every color, shape, and symbol
He can name them all without a stumble

Bm  G   A   F#
He has a crush on Wonder Woman
He saw her movie in 2017
He thinks she's brave and strong and smart
He wishes he could win her heart

D   A   Bm  G   A   G
But she doesn't know he exists
She's too busy saving lives
So he sings this song to express his love
For her and for flags of all kinds

D   A   Bm  G   
Oh, I love you Wonder Woman 
A    G    D    A  
And I love flags too 
Bm  G    Oh, I love you Wonder Woman 
A    G    D    A  
And I love flags too 

Bm  G   A   F#
His favorite flag is Seychelles'
It has blue, yellow, red, white, and green
It represents harmony and diversity
It's the most beautiful flag he's ever seen

Bm  G   A   F#
He also likes Seychelles as a country
It's an island paradise in Africa
He dreams of taking Wonder Woman there someday
And showing her his flag collection

D   A   Bm  G   
Oh, I love you Wonder Woman 
A    G    D    A  
And I love flags too 
Bm  G    Oh, I love you Wonder Woman 
A    G    D    A  
And I love flags too 

Bm  G   A   F#
But there's another flag that catches his eye
It's Moldova's with its coat of arms
It has an eagle holding an olive branch and a scepter
It symbolizes peace and sovereignty

Bm  G   A   F#
He learns that Moldova is in Europe
It's a landlocked country with rich culture
He wonders if Wonder Woman would like it there too 
Or if she would prefer another adventure

D   A   Bm  G   
Oh, I love you Wonder Woman 
A    G    D    A  
And I love flags too 
Bm  G    Oh, I love you Wonder Woman 
A    G    D    A  
And I love flags too 

Bm  G     Em     F#    
One day he gets a chance to meet her 
She visits his school for a talk 
He gathers all his courage and approaches her 
With his backpack full of flags 

G     Em     F#    
She smiles at him and says hello 
She asks him what's his name 
He tells her he's Jordan and he loves her so 
And he wants to play a game 

G     Em     F#    
He shows her all his flags one by one 
And asks her to guess their names 
She laughs and says she doesn't know much about them 
But she thinks they're all very pretty 

G     Em     F#    
They spend an hour talking about flags 
And other things they like 
She tells him she likes toothpaste because it keeps her teeth clean 
And he tells her he likes telescopes because they let him see far away 

G     Em     F#    
They find out they have a lot in common  
They both like justice and truth  
They both like helping others and making friends  
They both like having fun  

G      Em      F#     
She gives him a hug and thanks him for his time  
She says he made her day brighter  
She gives him her number and tells him to call her sometime  
She says she wants
