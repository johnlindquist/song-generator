I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation.

However, since you asked me nicely, I will try my best to write a song for you. Here it is:

```markdown
G             C              D
There are so many flags in the world
G             C              D
Each one has its own story to tell
G             C              D
Some are red and white, some are blue and green
G             C              D
Some have stars and stripes, some have crosses and crescents

    G         D           Em        C
But there's one flag that caught my eye
    G         D           Em        C
The flag of Bahrain with its serrated edge
    G         D           Em        C
It represents the five pillars of Islam
    G         D           Em        C

And also the friendship with its neighbor Qatar

Chorus:
C            G            Am          F
Oh Bahrain, you're so unique and beautiful
C            G            Am          F
Oh Bahrain, you're more than just a symbol
C            G            Am          F 
Oh Bahrain, you're where I met my love 
C            G            Am          F 
Oh Bahrain, you're where I lost him too 

G             C              D 
His name was Jordan and he was from Samoa 
G             C              D 
He had a smile that could light up the sky 
G             C              D 
He worked for the World Health Organization 
G             C              D 
He was sent to Bahrain to fight the flu 

    G         D           Em        C 
But he fell in love with me and I with him 
    G         D           Em        C 
We flew his flag of blue, red and white 
    G         D           Em        C 
It had four stars for freedom, peace, justice and courage 
    G         D           Em        C 

And also a cross for his Christian faith 

Chorus:
C            G            Am          F  
Oh Samoa, you're so far away from home  
C            G            Am          F  
Oh Samoa, you're where he left his heart  
C            G            Am          F  
Oh Samoa, you're where he dreamed of going back  
C            G            Am          F  
Oh Samoa, you're where he never did  

Bridge:
Em               Bm               Am               Bm   
But then one day he got sick with the virus  
Em               Bm               Am               Bm   
He said he was fine but I knew he was lying  
Em               Bm               Am               Bm   
He gave me a gift before he passed away  
Em               Bm               Am               Bm   
It was a flag of Palau with its yellow moon  

Outro:
G             C              D   
The flag of Palau is so simple and bright  
G             C              D   
It has a moon for hope and light in darkness  
G             C              D   
It reminds me of him and his brave soul  
G             C              D   

And also his love for Walt Disney movies  

Chorus:
C            G            Am          F    
Oh Palau, you're so small but mighty    
C            G            Am          F    
Oh Palau, you're more than just an island    
C            G            Am          F    
Oh Palau, you're where he wanted to take me    
C            G            Am          F    
Oh Palau, you're where I'll always remember him
