Here is a song I wrote for you. I hope you enjoy it. ðŸ˜Š

```
D             Bm
Zeus was feeling bored one day
G              F#
He wanted to explore the Milky Way
D              Bm
He took his thunderbolt and flew away
G              F#
Leaving Hera in dismay

A             G
He saw a quasar shining bright
Em             D
He thought it was a pretty sight
A             G
But then he noticed something strange
Em             D
A brown dwarf with a catchy name

D     A     Bm    G 
Luhman 16A, Luhman 16A
D     A     Bm    G 
Zeus was curious about you
D     A     Bm    G 
Luhman 16A, Luhman 16A
D     A     Bm    G 
What secrets do you hide?

D             Bm
He landed on the brown dwarf's surface
G              F#
He felt a sudden nervousness
D              Bm
He sensed a presence in the air
G              F#
A goddess with long golden hair

A             G 
She said her name was Aphrodite 
Em             D 
She was the queen of love and beauty 
A             G 
She said she came to Luhman 16A 
Em             D 
To find a lover who would stay 

D     A     Bm    G  
Luhman 16A, Luhman 16A 
D     A     Bm    G  
Zeus was tempted by her charms 
D     A     Bm    G  
Luhman 16A, Luhman 16A 
D     A     Bm    G  
He took her in his arms 

Bb            C  
But then they heard a thunderous roar 
F              Eb  
Hera had followed Zeus's trail 
Bb            C  
She was furious to see them there 
F              Eb  
She vowed to make them pay 

Eb    C    F    Bb  
Luhman 16A, Luhman 16A 
Eb    C    F    Bb  
Hera was angry with you 
Eb    C    F    Bb  
Luhman 16A, Luhman 16A 
Eb    C    F   (pause)   
What will she do? 

Bb            C  
She summoned all the other gods 
F              Eb  
She told them what she saw 
Bb            C  
They agreed to punish Zeus and Aphrodite 
F              Eb  
They declared a cosmic war 

Eb            Ab           Db           Eb   
They fought with lightning bolts and fireballs   
Eb            Ab           Db           Eb   
They shook the stars and planets with their rage   
Eb            Ab           Db           Eb   
They caused a great red spot on Jupiter's face   
Eb            Ab           Db           Eb   
They made Luhman 16A change its phase   

Db   Ab   Eb   F#    
Luhman 16A, Luhman 16A    
Db   Ab   Eb   F#    
You were caught in the crossfire    
Db   Ab   Eb   F#    
Luhman 16A, Luhman 16A    
Db   Ab   Eb   (pause)     
You became a vampire    

Db            Ab           
You lost your heat and light     
Eb            F#           
You turned into a dark star     
Db            Ab           
You hid yourself from sight     
Eb            F#           
You waited for revenge     

Gb      E      Ab      Db      
Luhman 16A, Luhman 16A      
Gb      E      Ab      Db      
You are still out there      
Gb      E      Ab      Db      
Luhman 16A, Luhman 16       
Gb      E      Ab       (pause)       
You are still waiting...
