Thank you for your kind words and your request. I will try my best to compose a song for you. Here is what I came up with:

```markdown
Gm  Eb  F  Dm
Jordan is a boy who loves geography
Gm  Eb  F  Dm
He knows all the flags of every country
Gm  Eb  F  Dm
He dreams of traveling around the world someday
Gm  Eb  F  Dm
And he's turning eleven on his birthday

Dm   F   C   G7
He wants to go to Qatar, where the flag is maroon and white
Dm   F   C   G7
He thinks it's very cool and he wants to see it in real life
Dm   F   C   G7
He asks his parents for a ticket as a present for his day
Dm   F   C   G7 
They say they'll think about it and they hope he'll be okay

Gm    Eb    F    Dm 
Jordan waits impatiently for his birthday to arrive 
Gm    Eb    F    Dm 
He checks the calendar every day and counts from five to five 
Gm    Eb    F    Dm 
He studies all the facts about Qatar and its culture too 
Gm    Eb    F    Dm 
He learns some Arabic words and phrases like "marhaba" and "shukran"

Dm   F   C   G7  
Finally his birthday comes and he wakes up with a smile 
Dm   F   C   G7  
He runs downstairs to see his parents and he hugs them for a while 
Dm   F   C   G7  
They give him a big envelope and he opens it with glee 
Dm   F   C     G7  
Inside there is a boarding pass that says "Qatar Airways"

Gm     Eb     F     D   
Jordan can't believe his eyes, he's going to Qatar today 
Gm     Eb     F     D   
He thanks his parents over and over and he packs his bags right away 
Gm     Eb     F     D   
He takes his passport and his flag book and he heads out to the airport 
Gm     Eb     F      D   
He boards the plane with excitement and he finds his window seat

Eb      Bb      Ab      Db    
This is the best day of his life, he's flying to Qatar tonight  
Eb      Bb      Ab      Db    
He can't wait to see the flag waving in the moonlight  
Eb      Bb      Ab      Db    
He hopes to make some friends there and learn more about their ways  
Eb      Bb       Ab       Db    
He sings this song in his head as he flies across the bay

Jordan is a boy who loves geography (geography)  
He knows all the flags of every country (country)  
He dreams of traveling around the world someday (someday)  
And he's turning eleven on his birthday (birthday)
