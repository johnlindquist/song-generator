Okay, I will try to write a song about the historic Apollo missions to the Moon and fairy godmothers in the style of They Might be Giants. Here is what I came up with:

```markdown
Gm   Eb   Bb   F
She was a fairy godmother
Gm   Eb   Bb   F
He was an astronaut
Gm   Eb   Bb   F
They met at a lunar landing
Gm   Eb   Bb   F
And they fell in love on the spot

Dm  Eb  Gm  D7
But their worlds were so different
Dm  Eb  Gm  D7
They couldn't be together
Dm  Eb  Gm  D7
So they made a wish upon a star 
Dm    Eb    Gm    D7 
That would change their lives forever

Gm    C    D    Gm 
They might be giants (they might be giants)
Gm    C    D    Gm 
They might be small (they might be small)
Gm    C    D    Gm 
They might be flying (they might be flying)
Gm     C     D     Gm 
Or they might fall (or they might fall)

Eb      Bb      F      G7 
But they don't care about the gravity
Eb      Bb      F      G7 
Or the magic that they use
Eb      Bb      F      G7 
All they care about is each other
Eb       Bb       F       G7 
And their lunar rendezvous

She gave him a pair of wings
He gave her a space suit
They explored the craters and the seas
And they danced to the moon's music

But their time was running out
They had to go back home soon
So they made another wish upon a star 
That would make them immune

To the forces that would tear them apart (tear them apart)
To the rules that would bind them (bind them)
To the fears that would haunt them (haunt them)
To the doubts that would blind them (blind them)

But they don't care about the gravity...
