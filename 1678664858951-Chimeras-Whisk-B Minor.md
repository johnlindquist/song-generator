Okay, I'm ready to show you what I've got! Here's my song about the flags of the world. It's a parody of "We Are The World" by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie. I hope you like it! ðŸ˜Š

Bm   G    D    A
There comes a time
When we need to see
The flags that fly
Across this world so free

Bm   G    D    A
There are so many kinds
Of colors, shapes and signs
They represent our lands
And our history

G     A      Bm   F#
Some have stripes or stars or crosses
G     A      Bm   F#
Some have moons or suns or blossoms
G     A      Bm   F#
Some have animals or plants or weapons
G     A      D    A/C#
But they all have something in common

D    F#m  G    A 
We are the flags (we are)
D    F#m  G    A 
We are diverse (we are)
D    F#m  G    A 
We show our pride (we show)
D    F#m  G    A 
We wave up high (we wave)

D    F#m  G       A 
Let's take a look around us (let's take a look)
D    F#m  G       A 
And see what we can find (and see what we can find)
D    F#m  G       A 
There's so much beauty and wonder (so much beauty)
D        E        D/F#
In every flag design

Bm   G     D     A
Have you seen Andorra?
It has red, yellow and blue
With a coat of arms in the middle
That tells its story too

Bm   G     D     A
How about Maldives?
It has green, red and white
With a crescent moon that symbolizes
Its faith and its light

G     A      Bm   F#
Some have triangles or squares or circles
G     A      Bm   F#
Some have patterns or textures or swirls
G     A      Bm   F#
Some have symbols or words or numbers
G     A      D    A/C#
But they all belong to this world

(Chorus)

Bm   G     D     A  
Don't forget Marshall Islands 
It has blue, white and orange  
With a star that points to directions  
Where its people can forge  

Bm   G     D     A  
There are so many more to discover  
So many stories to uncover  
They're not just pieces of cloth  
They're expressions of love  

(Chorus)

D        E        D/F#
In every flag design...
