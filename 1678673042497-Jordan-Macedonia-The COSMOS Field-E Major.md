Okay, I'll try my best to compose a song for you. I hope you like it. Here it is:

```markdown
C#m  A   E   B
Jordan was a boy who lived in Macedonia
C#m  A   E   B
He had a dream to travel to Micronesia
C#m  A   E   B
But he didn't have enough money or a visa
C#m  A   E   B
So he decided to hitchhike across Asia

E    B    A    E
He met some friendly people on the way
E    B    A    E
They gave him food and shelter every day
E    B    A    E
But he also met some trouble on the road
E    B    A    E 
He stumbled upon a secret necromancer code

A     B     C#m     G#
They were plotting to raise an army of the dead
A     B     C#m     G#
They wanted to take over the world with dread
A     B     C#m     G#
They saw Jordan as a spy and captured him alive 
A     B     C#m     
They threw him in a dungeon where he couldn't survive

C#m  A   E   B 
Jordan was scared and lonely in the dark 
C#m  A   E   B 
He wished he had stayed home with his mom and dad 
C#m  A   E   B 
He prayed for someone to rescue him from this nightmare 
C#m  A   E   B 
He didn't know that help was on its way from somewhere 

E    B    A    E 
In Palau, there was a team of scientists working hard 
E    B    A    E 
They were studying the COSMOS field, a patch of stars so large 
E    B    A    E  
They detected an anomaly, a signal from afar 
E    B    A    
It was coming from Jordan's cell phone, he had left it in his car 

A     B      C#m      G#
They traced the location of the source  
A     B      C#m      G#
They found out it was in an ancient fort  
A     B      C#m      G#
They realized it was a necromancer base  
A     B      C#m      
They decided to go there and save Jordan's case 

C#m  A   E   B  
They flew to Macedonia in their private jet  
C#m  A   E   B  
They brought some weapons and some gadgets they had made  
C#m  A   E   B  
They infiltrated the fortress with stealth and skill  
C#m  A   E   
They fought their way through zombies until they reached Jordan's cell 

E       F#/G#
Jordan, Jordan, we're here to save you   
B       F#/G#
Jordan, Jordan, we're your heroes too   
F#/G#/B/A/E/B/F#/G#/B/A/E/B/F#/G#/B/A/E/B/F#/G#/B/A/E/B/F#/G#
Jordan, Jordan, don't be afraid now   
F#/G#/B/A/E/B/F#/G#/B/A/E/B/F#/G#
Jordan, Jordan, we'll get you out somehow   

F/G/C/G/Am/G/F/G/C/G/Am/G/F/G/C/G/Am/G/
(Solo)

F       G       Am       Em       
But just when they thought they had won   
F       G       Am       Em       
The necromancers unleashed their final plan   
F       G       Am       Em       
They activated a device that caused a massive quake   
F       G       Am       
It triggered a tsunami that headed for Samoa's lake   

Am        Em        F         D        
The scientists saw the news on their TV screen   
Am        Em        F         D        
They knew they had to stop the wave before it hit   
Am        Em        F         D        
They used their jet to fly over the ocean blue   
Am        Em        F         
They dropped some bombs that created a counter-wave too   

F          D          Am          Em          
The waves collided and canceled each other out   
F          D          Am          Em          
The people of Samoa cheered and shouted out loud
