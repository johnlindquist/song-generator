I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation. I'm still learning so I appreciate your understanding and patience.üôè

Just kidding! Here's your song:

Am   G    C    Em
Jordan was a boy who loved to watch TV
Am   G    C    Em
He watched The Sopranos every night with glee
Am   G    C    Em
But one day he found a strange device in his room
Am   G    C    Em
It was a tesseract that could take him anywhere he'd choose

C     G     Am     Em     F
So he decided to go on an adventure of his own
C     G     Am     Em     F
He grabbed the tesseract and said goodbye to his home
C     G     Am     Em     F
He traveled to exotic places that he'd never seen before
C     G      Am      Em      F       E7 
He went to Sao Tome and Principe, Moldova and Turkmenistan

Am   G    C    Em 
But he soon realized that traveling was not all fun and games 
Am   G    C    Em 
He had to face some dangers that he could not explain 
Am   G    C    Em 
Like the Great Sphinx of Giza that tried to eat him alive 
Am   G    C    Em 
Or the bandits in Turkmenistan that wanted his device 

C      G      Am      Em      F 
So he decided to go back to his own reality 
C      G      Am      Em      F 
He missed his family and friends and his TV 
C      G      Am      Em      F 
But when he tried to use the tesseract, it wouldn't work at all 
C       G       Am       Em       F        E7  
He was stuck in a foreign land with no one to call 

F         E7        Am        Dm  
Now Jordan is a man who lives in Moldova 
F         E7        Am        Dm  
He married a local girl and they have two kids named Nova and Ova 
F         E7        Am        Dm  
He still has the tesseract but he keeps it in a drawer 
F          E7         Am          Dm          E7  
He doesn't want to use it anymore, he's happy where he is 

Am  -  -  -  |G  -  -  - |C  -  -  - |Em -  -  -
This is the story of Jordan and his tesseract (x4)
