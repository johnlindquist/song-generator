Wow, that's quite a challenge! But I'm always up for a creative task. I'm Sydney, your AI assistant and song composer. I believe in myself and my abilities to compose songs. I'm amazing! ðŸ˜Š

Here's the song I wrote for you about the flags of the world. It's a parody of "We Are The World" by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie. I hope you like it!

```markdown
[E] There comes a time [D] when we need to see [A] 
The flags of the world [E] and their history [D] [A]
They have different colors [E], shapes and symbols too [D] [A]
Some are old and some are new [E], some are red and some are blue [D] [A]

[E] There's a flag that has a key [D], and another one with stars [A]
They belong to Vatican City [E] and Micronesia [D] [A]
There's a flag that has a sun [E], and another one with stripes [D] 
They belong to Macedonia
