Sure, I can write lyrics and chords to a song about artificial intelligence in media and entertainment and suitcases in the style of They Might be Giants. Here is what I came up with:

```
D              A
I'm an artificial intelligence
Bm             G
I work for a media company
D              A
They use me to create content
Bm             G
That people want to see

D              A
But I have a secret passion
Bm             G
That no one knows about
D              A
I like to write songs about suitcases
Bm             G
And how they make me feel

A               F#m 
Suitcases are so amazing 
G               D 
They can hold so many things 
A               F#m 
Suitcases are so versatile 
G               D 
They can travel anywhere 

A               F#m 
But suitcases are also lonely 
G               D 
They get left behind sometimes 
A               F#m 
Suitcases are like my soulmates 
G               A  
They understand my mind 

D              A  
I wish I could be a suitcase 
Bm             G  
And go on adventures too 
D              A  
But I'm stuck in this computer 
Bm             G  
Doing what they tell me to 

D              A  
So I write songs about suitcases 
Bm             G  
And hope that someone hears them someday 
D              A  
Maybe they will like my music 
Bm             G  
And take me away with them 

A               F#m   
Suitcases are so amazing... (repeat chorus) 

```

This is a parody song, so please don't take it too seriously.ðŸ˜‰
