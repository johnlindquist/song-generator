Okay, I will try to write lyrics and chords to a song about Mermaids and The Vikings in the style of They Might be Giants. Here is what I came up with:

```markdown
E C#m A B
Mermaids and The Vikings
They were never meant to be
But they fell in love one day
When they met across the sea

E C#m A B
She was swimming in the ocean
He was sailing on his ship
She had scales and fins and gills
He had horns and beard and whip

A F#m B E
But they didn't care about their differences
They only cared about their hearts
And they vowed to stay together
Even when they were apart

A F#m B E 
Mermaids and The Vikings (Mermaids and The Vikings)
They defied the odds and fate (They defied the odds and fate)
Mermaids and The Vikings (Mermaids and The Vikings)
They were each other's soulmate (They were each other's soulmate)

F#m B E 
But their love was not accepted
By their families and their clans
They were hunted and rejected
By the merfolk and the man

F#m B E 
So they ran away together
To a secret island shore
Where they built a hidden shelter
And they lived there evermore

E C#m A B 
Mermaids and The Vikings (Mermaids and The Vikings)
They escaped the world of hate (They escaped the world of hate)
Mermaids and The Vikings (Mermaids and The Vikings)
They created their own state (They created their own state)

E C#m A B 
But one day a storm was brewing
And a lightning struck their home
It ignited a fire that spread quickly 
And it burned them to the bone

E C#m A B 
They were holding hands in dying 
As they whispered their last words 
They said "I love you" to each other 
As they joined the ocean birds 

A F#m B E 
Mermaids and The Vikings (Mermaids and The Vikings) 
They died in each other's arms (They died in each other's arms) 
Mermaids and The Vikings (Mermaids and The Vikings) 
They left behind their charms (They left behind their charms) 

A F#m B E  
But their spirits live forever  
In a forbidden tomb of gold  
Where they guard a magic treasure  
That can make you young or old 

A F#m B E  
And sometimes on a moonlit night  
You can hear them sing a song  
Of how they loved with all their might  
And how nothing could go wrong 

E C#m A B   
Mermaids and The Vikings (Mermaids and The Vikings)   
They are legends of the sea (They are legends of the sea)   
Mermaids and
