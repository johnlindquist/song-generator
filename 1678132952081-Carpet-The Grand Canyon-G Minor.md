Here is a song I wrote for you:

```markdown
Gm  Eb  Bb  D
I bought a carpet from a store
Gm  Eb  Bb  D
It was so soft and had no flaw
Gm  Eb  Bb  D
But when I brought it to my home
Gm  Eb  Bb  D
I found a label that said "Rome"

Cm   Bb   F
And then I wondered what it meant
Cm   Bb   F
Was it a clue or an accident?
Cm   Bb   F
I searched online and found a site
Cm   Bb   F    G7 
That said this carpet could take flight

Chorus:
Cm    Bb    F    G7 
Carpet, carpet, show me the way
Cm    Bb    F    G7 
Take me to places I've never seen today
Cm    Bb    F    G7 
Carpet, carpet, don't let me down
Cm    Bb    F    
Fly me to Rome or maybe even to

Gm  Eb  Bb  D  
The Grand Canyon where I've always dreamed to go
Gm  Eb  Bb  D  
But never had the time or money or the dough
Gm  Eb  Bb  D  
But now I have this magic carpet on my floor
Gm  Eb  Bb     D   
And all I have to do is say the magic word

Cm   Bb   F  
But what is it? I don't know yet 
Cm   Bb   F  
Maybe it's something that I'll regret 
Cm   Bb   F  
Maybe it's something that makes no sense 
Cm   Bb     F      G7   
Like soccer ball or keyboard cleaner or

Chorus:
Carpet, carpet, show me the way ...
