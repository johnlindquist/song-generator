Here is the song I composed for you:

```markdown
Verse 1:
A              D      E       D
Jordan is a boy who loves geography
A              D      E       D
He knows all the flags of every country
A              D      E       D
He likes to draw them on his notebook page
A              D      E       D
And he can name them all without a mistake

Chorus:
F#m            C#m    Bm      E
But he has a secret that he never told
F#m            C#m    Bm      E
He dreams of going to outer space someday
F#m            C#m    Bm      E
He wants to see the planets and the stars
F#m            C#m    Bm      E 
And maybe even land on Ceres or Mars

Verse 2:
A              D      E       D 
One night he saw a shooting star in the sky
A              D      E       D 
He made a wish and closed his eyes really tight
A              D      E       D 
He wished that he could have a rocket ship 
A              D      E       D 
And go on an adventure that was epic

Chorus:
F#m            C#m    Bm      E 
But he had a secret that he never told 
F#m            C#m    Bm      E 
He dreams of going to outer space someday 
F#m            C#m    Bm      E 
He wants to see the planets and the stars 
F#m            C#m    Bm      E  
And maybe even land on Ceres or Mars 

Bridge:
D             A/C#
The next morning he woke up with a surprise 
B             G/B     
There was a rocket ship outside his house 
D             A/C#
It had his name written on the side 
B             G/B     
And it was ready to take him out 

Verse 3:
A              D     E        D  
Jordan got inside and put on his helmet 
A              D     E        D  
He pressed some buttons and started the engine 
A              D     E        D  
He flew away into the atmosphere  
A              D     E        D  
He felt so happy and so free 

Chorus:
F#m            C#m   Bm       E  
But he had a secret that he never told  
F#m            C#m   Bm       E  
He dreams of going to outer space someday  
F#m            C#m   B
