Okay, I'll try my best to compose a song for you. Here it is:

# Flags of the World

Verse 1:
C#m    A      E       B
Jordan was a curious boy
C#m    A      E       B
He loved to travel and explore
C#m    A      E       B
He had a passion for the flags
C#m    A      E       B
Of every country he adored

Pre-chorus:
F#m    G#m    A       B
He liked the red and white of Malta
F#m    G#m    A       B
The green, yellow, and black of Guyana
F#m    G#m    A       B
The blue, white, and red of Kiribati
F#m    G#m    A       B 
But there was one flag that stole his heart

Chorus:
E      A      B       
The flag of France, oh la la la 
E      A      B       
It made him feel so fancy 
E      A      B       
He dreamed of kissing by the tower 
E      A      B       
The Eiffel Tower in Paris 

Verse 2:
C#m    A      E       B
Jordan saved up all his money 
C#m    A      E       B 
He bought a ticket to France 
C#m    A      E       B 
He packed his bags and sunscreen 
C#m    A      E       B 
He was ready for romance 

Pre-chorus:
F#m    G#m    A       B 
He saw the flag waving in the breeze 
F#m    G#m    A       B  
He felt a flutter in his chest 
F#m    G#m    A       B  
He ran towards the tower with glee 
F#m     G     C     D  
But then he saw something that made him freeze 

Chorus:
G     C     D     
The flag of France, oh no no no  
G     C     D     
It was not what he expected  
G     C     D     
There was another boy by the tower  
G     C     D     
The Eiffel Tower had rejected him 

Bridge:
Em   Am   C   D   
Jordan felt so sad and lonely  
Em   Am   C   D   
He wanted to go back home  
Em   Am   C   D   
But then he heard a voice behind him  
Em   Am   C   D   
It said "Hey, you're not alone"

Verse 3:
Am  F  C  G   
Jordan turned around and smiled  
Am  F  C  G   
He saw a girl with sparkling eyes  
Am  F  C  G   
She wore a dress with many colors  
Am  F  C  G   
She said "I'm here to show you why"

Pre-chorus:
Dm   Em   F   G   
She liked the flags of the world too  
Dm   Em   F   G   
She had traveled far and wide  
Dm   Em   F   G   
She said "There's more than one flag for you"  
Dm        Em        F        G    
And then she took him by the hand and said

Chorus: (key change)
A     D     E     
Let's go see the ocean blue  
A     D     E     
The Pacific Ocean is so grand  
A     D     E     
We can swim and surf and have some fun  
A         D         E         
And maybe find our own island 

Outro: (fade out)
A         D         E         
We can make our own flag there too (our own flag there too)    
A         D         E         
We can make it any way we want (any way we want)    
A         D         E         
We can make it with love and care (love and care)    
A         D         E         
We can make it with flags of the world (flags of the world)
