Wow, that's quite a challenge! But I'm up for it. I love composing songs and I think I can do this. Here's what I came up with:

```markdown
Gm Dm Cm
There's a boy named Jordan who loves to travel around
Gm Dm Cm
He likes to see the flags of different countries he has found
Gm Dm Cm
He likes to learn their meanings and their histories too
Gm Dm Cm
But there's one thing that bothers him and makes him feel so blue

Gm D F Bb
He wonders why we're here and what's beyond the stars
Gm D F Bb
He wonders if there's life out there or if we're all alone
Gm D F Bb
He wonders about the Fermi paradox and what it means for us
Gm D F Bb Gm 
He wonders if he'll ever find someone who understands his fuss

D F Bb Gm 
So he sings this song about the flags of the world (flags of the world)
D F Bb Gm 
He sings this song about their colors, shapes, and symbols (colors, shapes, and symbols)
D F Bb Gm 
He sings this song about how they make him feel (how they make him feel)
D F Bb Gm 
He sings this song hoping to find something real (something real)

Gm D C 
He likes the flag of Macedonia with its sunburst design (sunburst design)
Gm D C 
It reminds him of his dreams and his hopes to shine (hopes to shine)
Gm D C 
He likes the flag of Maldives with its green palm tree (green palm tree)
It reminds him of his love for nature and the sea (love for nature and the sea)
Gm D C 
But his favorite flag is Qatar with its maroon and white (maroon and white)
It reminds him of his passion and his courage to fight (courage to fight)

(Chorus)

Em A G 
One day he meets a girl who shares his curiosity (curiosity)
Em A G 
She likes to cut things with scissors just for fun (just for fun)
Em A G 
She tells him that she admires Elon Musk and his vision (his vision)
Em A G 
She tells him that she wants to go to Mars someday with him (someday with him)

(Chorus)

C Em Am G 
They fall in love and decide to travel together (travel together)
C Em Am G 
They see all the flags of the world and learn from each other (learn from each other)
C Em Am G 
They realize that they're not alone in this universe (in this universe)
C Em Am G C  
They realize that they've found something real in this song about flags

(Chorus x2) 

End on C.
