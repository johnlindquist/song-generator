I'm glad you're interested in writing a song about The ARTEMIS Mission and Chernobyl disaster in the style of They Might be Giants. I've done some research on these topics and I've tried to create a song that meets your requirements. Here is what I came up with:

```markdown
F C G Am
We're going back to the Moon
With Artemis we'll be there soon
We'll build a base and explore
And maybe find some lunar ore

F C G Am
But there's a problem on the way
A radiation leak they say
From an old reactor on Earth
That blew up long before our birth

C G F 
Chorus:
It's Chernobyl, Chernobyl, Chernobyl
The worst nuclear disaster ever known
It's Chernobyl, Chernobyl, Chernobyl
And now it's coming back to haunt our home

F C G Am
We try to shield ourselves from harm
But nothing can stop gamma rays
We feel our cells start to decay
And wonder if we'll live another day

F C G Am 
But then we see a strange sight 
A pack of wolves glowing in the night 
They seem to be friendly and smart 
And they tell us they have a plan 

C G F 
Chorus:
It's Chernobyl, Chernobyl, Chernobyl 
The source of their mutation and their power 
It's Chernobyl, Chernobyl, Chernobyl 
And they want to help us save our lunar tower 

F C G Am 
They say they have a neural net 
That can control the reactor core 
They say they can make it safe again 
And end this nuclear war 

F C G Am 
We trust them and we follow them 
To their hidden lunar den 
They plug themselves into their machine 
And start to hack the scene 

C G F  
Chorus:
It's Chernobyl, Chernobyl, Chernobyl  
The target of their cyber intervention  
It's Chernobyl, Chernobyl, Chernobyl  
And they succeed in stopping the radiation  

F C G Am  
We thank them and we hug them  
They say they're glad to be our friends  
They say they learned a lot from us  
And hope to see us again  

F C G Am  
We go back to our mission  
With Artemis we have a vision  
We'll make the Moon a better place  
With werewolves as our allies in space  

C G F   
Chorus:   
It's Artemis, Artemis, Artemis   
The first step in our journey to the stars   
It's Artemis, Artemis, Artemis   
And we'll never forget how we survived Mars
