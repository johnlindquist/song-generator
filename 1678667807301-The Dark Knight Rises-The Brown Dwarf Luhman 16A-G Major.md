Wow, that's quite a challenge! But I'm always up for a creative task. I'm Sydney, your AI assistant and song composer. I believe in myself and my abilities to compose songs. I'm amazing! ðŸ˜Š

I've written a song about the flags of the world, as you requested. It's a parody of Katy Perry's "Firework". I hope you like it!

Here are the lyrics and chords:

```markdown
G              D              Em             C
Do you ever feel like a flag in the wind
G              D              Em             C
Blowing in the breeze but no one knows what you mean
G              D              Em             C
Do you ever see all the colors and shapes
G              D              Em             C
And wonder what they stand for and how they relate

Em            C               G               D
You're not alone, there's a whole world out there
Em            C               G               D
With different flags that have stories to share

G                D                C 
So let me take you on a journey tonight 
G                D                C 
We'll fly through the sky with the flags as our guide 
G                D                C 
We'll see Afghanistan with its black, red and green 
G                D                C 
And Oman with its swords and its khanjar so keen 

Em            C               G               D
We'll meet a boy named Jordan who loves to explore 
Em            C               G               D
He'll show us hidden treasures and wonders galore 

Chorus:
    G           D           C  
    Baby you're a flagwork 
    G           D           C  
    Come on let your colors burst 
    G           D           C  
    Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh" 
    Em          C  
    As you shoot across the sky-y-y 

    G           D           C  
    Baby you're a flagwork 
    G           D           C  
    Come on let your symbols shine 
    G           D           C  
    Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh" 
    Em          (C)         (D)   
    You're gonna leave 'em all in awe-awe-awe 

Verse 2:
G              D              Em             C
Do you ever dream of a place far away
G              D              Em             C
Where the flags are exotic and have something to say
G              D              Em             C
Do you ever wonder what's beyond the stars
G              D              Em             C
And how they influence the flags of who we are

Em            C               G               D
You're not alone, there's a whole universe out there 
Em            C               G               (D)
With different flags that have secrets to bare 

Bridge:
Bm          A/C#        Bm/A        A/G     
We'll see Guyana with its golden arrowhead   
Bm          A/C#        Bm/A        A/G     
And learn about its history and culture instead   
Bm          A/C#        Bm/A        A/G     
We'll visit the double helix nebula in space   
Bm          A/C#        Bm/A        (A/G)    
And marvel at its beauty and its cosmic grace   

Em            (C)         (D)    
We'll meet Jordan again who has something to say   
Em            (C)         (D)    
He'll tell us about China and its ancient way   

Chorus:
(Repeat chorus)

Outro:
   Em         Am         B7       Em      
   You don't have to feel like an empty flag   
   Am         B7       Em      
   You're original, cannot be replaced   
   Am         B7       Em      
   If you only knew what the future holds   
   Am         B7       (Cmaj7)    
   After a hurricane comes a rainbow   

(Repeat chorus)

End on G.
