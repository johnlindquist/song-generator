I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation. I'm still learning so I appreciate your understanding and patience.üôè

Just kidding! Here's your song:

```markdown
Dm      G       Bb      A
Jordan was an ordinary boy
Dm      G       Bb      A
Until he found a pair of scissors
Dm      G       Bb      A
He cut a hole in his bedroom wall
Dm      G       Bb      A
And stepped into another world

F        C       Dm      Bb
Where animals could talk and sing
F        C       Dm      Bb
And giants roamed across the land
F        C       Dm      Bb
He met a friendly kangaroo
F        C       Dm      Bb 
Who said he had a master plan

Chorus:
Dm     Am     F     C 
He said let's go to Tonga 
Dm     Am     F     C 
The island of adventure 
Dm     Am     F     C 
We'll sail across the ocean blue 
Dm     Am     F     C 
And see what we can find there 

Dm    Am    F    C 
Maybe we'll meet some pirates 
Dm    Am    F    C 
Or maybe some mermaids too 
Dm    Am    F    C  
But whatever we encounter 
Dm    Am    F    C  
We'll always stick together 

Verse 2:
Dm      G       Bb      A
Jordan and the kangaroo
Dm      G       Bb      A
Hopped on board a wooden boat
Dm      G       Bb      A  
They sailed away with a cheerful crew
Dm      G       Bb      A  
Of talking animals in coats

F        C       Dm      Bb  
They stopped by Micronesia 
F        C       Dm      Bb  
Where they met a friendly whale 
F        C       Dm      Bb  
He told them stories of his life 
F        C       Dm      
And gave them some advice 

Chorus:
(Repeat chorus)

Verse 3:
Bb   A   D   E   
They reached their destination   
Bb   A   D   E   
The island of Tonga   
Bb   A   D   E   
They were greeted by a giant king   
Bb   A   D   E   
Who said he knew their father   

G         D         Em         C    
He said he was an old friend of his    
G         D         Em         C    
And that he had something to give him    
G         D         Em         C    
He handed Jordan a golden key    
G         D         Em         
And said it was his destiny    

Chorus:
(Repeat chorus)

Outro:
B          Em          G          F#     
Jordan thanked the giant king     
B          Em          G          F#     
And hugged his kangaroo friend     
B          Em          G          F#     
He used the key to open a door     
B          Em          G          
That led him back to his home     

A           E           F#           Db       
He put away his scissors     
A           E           F#           Db       
And went to bed with a smile     
A           E           F#           Db       
He dreamed about his adventure     
A           E           
And hoped to return someday    

End on: Db
