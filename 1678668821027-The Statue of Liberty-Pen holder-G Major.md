# Flags of the World

Verse 1:
G              Em             Bm              C
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel around the world
G              Em             Bm              C
He had a special gift, he could talk to any animal
G              Em             Bm              C
He learned their stories, their secrets, and their wisdom too
G              Em             Bm              C
And every time he saw a flag, he sang this little tune

Chorus:
G               D               C               D
Flags of the world, flags of the world, what do they mean?
G               D               C               D
Flags of the world, flags of the world, what do they say?
G               D               C               D
Some are red and white, some are blue and green
G               D               C               D
Some have stars and stripes, some have suns and moons

Verse 2:
G              Em             Bm              C
Jordan went to Monaco, a tiny country by the sea
G              Em             Bm              C
He met a friendly dolphin who taught him how to swim free
G              Em             Bm              C
The dolphin said the flag was red and white for love and peace
G              Em             Bm              C 
And Jordan sang along with him as they swam in harmony

(Chorus)

Verse 3:
G              Em             Bm              C 
Jordan flew to Suriname, a land of forests and rivers 
G              Em             Bm              C 
He met a wise jaguar who showed him how to heal with herbs 
G              Em             Bm              C 
The jaguar said the flag was green for nature, white for hope 
G              Em             Bm              C 
And yellow for gold and red for progress as they roamed 

(Chorus)

Verse 4:
G                Em            Bm            C 
Jordan sailed to Seychelles, an island paradise 
G                Em            Bm            C 
He met a playful parrot who taught him how to fly 
G                Em            Bm            C 
The parrot said the flag was blue for sky and sea 
C                G           A          D  
Yellow for sun, red for people, green for land 

(Chorus)

Outro:
C                G           A          D  
Flags of the world, flags of the world (repeat until fade)
