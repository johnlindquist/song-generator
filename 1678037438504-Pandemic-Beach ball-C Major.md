# Pandemic and Beach Ball

C G Am F G F
There was a pandemic that swept across the land
C G Am F G F
It made people sick and scared and sad
C G Am F G F
But there was one thing that gave them hope and joy
C G Am F G F
A giant beach ball that they could play with and enjoy

C F G F
Pandemic and beach ball (Yeah)
C F G F
They don't seem to go together at all (No)
C F G F
But somehow they make each other better (How?)
C F G F
Pandemic and beach ball

C G Am F G F
The beach ball was a gift from an unknown source
C G Am F G F
It came with a note that said "Don't be morose"
C G Am F G F
It bounced around the city like a friendly ghost
C G Am F G F 
It made people laugh and smile when they needed it most

[Chorus]

Am Em Dm C 
But then one day the beach ball popped 
Am Em Dm C 
It was an accident or maybe not 
Am Em Dm C 
Some people said it was a plot 
Am Em Dm C 
By The Walking Dead or The Godfather 

G C E A 
Who knows who did it or why they did it 
G C E A 
But it doesn't really matter now does it 
G C E A 
The beach ball is gone and we're all alone again 
G C E A  
In this pandemic that never seems to end 

[Chorus]

Fmaj7 Em7 Dm7 Cmaj7 Bdim7 Am7 Abdim7  
But wait there's more to this story than meets the eye  
Fmaj7 Em7 Dm7 Cmaj7 Bdim7 Am7 Abdim7  
The beach ball was not just a toy but a spy  
Fmaj7 Em7 Dm7 Cmaj7 Bdim7 Am7 Abdim7  
It had a camera and a microphone inside  
Fmaj7 Em7 Dm7 Cmaj7 Bdim  Am  Abdim   
And it recorded everything that we did and said  

G  Ab  A  Bb  B  C   
And now we're on TV for everyone to see  
G  Ab  A  Bb  B  C   
Our pandemic lives are a reality show  
G  Ab  A  Bb  B   C   
And we're famous for our misery  
G   Ab   A   Bb   B   C   
Thanks to pandemic and beach ball  

[Chorus x2]
