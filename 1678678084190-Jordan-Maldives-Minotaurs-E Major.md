Okay, I'll try my best to compose a song for you. Here's what I came up with:

```markdown
E       A       B       A
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel
E       A       B       A
He had a map and a big backpack
E       A       B       A
He wanted to see every country in the world
E       A       B       A
But he had a problem, he was afraid of water

E      C#m     A      B
So he decided to go to Maldives first
E      C#m     A      B
He thought it would be easy and fun
E      C#m     A      B
But he didn't know what was waiting for him there
E      C#m     A      B 
A giant tsunami and a minotaur

Chorus:
A        E        F#m    B 
Oh no, oh no, what will he do?
A        E        F#m    B 
He's trapped on an island with a beast
A        E        F#m    B 
He needs to find a way to escape
A        E        F#m    B 
Or he'll become the minotaur's feast

E       A       B       A
Jordan ran as fast as he could 
E       A       B       A   
He saw a boat on the shore 
E       A       B       A   
He jumped on it and started to row 
E       A   G   D   C   G   D   E  
But the minotaur followed him with a roar 

(Change key to G major)

G      Em     C     D  
He sailed across the ocean blue 
G      Em     C     D  
He hoped to find another land 
G      Em     C     D  
But he got lost and didn't have a clue 
G      Em  Am  G  F  Am  G  G7  
Where he was or where he should go 

Chorus:
C         G         Am    D  
Oh no, oh no, what will he do? 
C         G         Am    D  
He's alone on the sea with no map 
C         G         Am    D  
He needs to find a way to get back 
C         G         Am    D  
Or he'll never see his home again 

G          D          Em          C   
Then he saw a sign that said "Welcome to Vanuatu" 
G          D          Em          C   
He thought it was his lucky day 
G          D          Em          C   
But he didn't know what was waiting for him there 
G          D  F  Eb  Db  Abmaj7/C Dbmaj7/Bb Ebmaj7/Ab Abmaj7/Gb Dbmaj7/F Ebmaj7/Eb Abmaj7/Db Dbmaj7/C Ebmaj7/Bb Abmaj7/A Dbmaj7/Ab Ebmaj7/G Ab (Change key back to E major)    
An army of Apple Inc. robots 

Chorus:
A        E        F#m    B  
Oh no, oh no, what will he do? 
A        E        F#m    B  
He's surrounded by machines with lasers 
A        E        F#m    B  
He needs to find a way to fight them off 
A        E        F#m    B  
Or he'll become their latest victim 

Bridge:
F#m             G#m             A              E    
Then he remembered his backpack had something inside 
F#m             G#m             A              E    
It was a gift from his grandma before he left home 
F#m             G#m             A              E    
It was a ticket to Vatican City, the smallest country in the world 
F#m             G#m             A              E    
He thought maybe there he could find some peace and hope 

(Change tempo and style)

E           Esus4           Esus2           Esus4           
So he used his ticket as a shield against the robots' rays     
E           Esus4           Esus2           Esus4           
And ran towards the nearest airport that he could find     
E           Esus4           Esus2           Esus4           
He boarded a plane that was heading to Rome     
E           Esus4           Esus2           Esus4           
And hoped that Vatican City would be kind     

Chorus:
A            Asus4            Asus2            Asus4            
Oh yes, oh yes, this is what he'll do     
A
