Here is a song I wrote about the history of China in the style of They Might be Giants:

Verse 1:
G A Bm F#m
China is among the oldest civilizations
G A Bm F#m
It has thousands of years of continuous history
G A Bm F#m
From the Xia to the Qing, it had many dynasties
G A Bm F#m
Each with its own culture, achievements, and mystery

Chorus:
D A Bm F#m G
But China is not just ancient history
D A Bm F#m G
It's also a modern country with technology
D A Bm F#m G
It has hackers, rockets, pandas, and factories
D A Bm F#m G 
And it's always in the news for some controversy

Verse 2:
G A Bm F#m 
China was unified by Qin Shi Huangdi 
G A Bm F#m 
He built the Great Wall and burned many books 
G A Bm F#m 
He claimed he had the Mandate of Heaven to rule 
G A Bm F#m 
But he was also paranoid and cruel 

Chorus:
D A Bm F#M G 
But China is not just ancient history 
D A Bn F#M G 
It's also a modern country with technology

And it's always in the news for some controversy 

Verse 3: 
G A BM FM  
China was invaded by Mongols and Manchus  
G A BM FM  
It faced rebellions, wars, and famines too  
G A BM FM  
It became a republic after overthrowing the last emperor

But then it had a civil war that split it into two

Verse 4:   
GA BM FM   
China became communist under Mao Zedong   
GA BM FM   
He launched campaigns that went horribly wrong   
GA BM FM   
He died in 1976 and Deng Xiaoping took over   
GA BM FM    
He opened up China to reforms and trade with others   

Chorus:

Verse 5:     
GA BMFM      
China is now led by Xi Jinping      
GA BMFM      
He wants to make China strong and prosperous again      
GA BMFM      
He faces challenges from democracy protests and coronavirus      
GA BMWFM       
And he has a rivalry with Donald Trump who lost his office       

Chorus:       
DA BMWFM        
But China is not just ancient history        
DA BMWFM

And it's always in the news for some controversy         

Outro:          
GA BMWFM          
China is an amazing place with so much diversity          
GA BMWFM          
It has mountains, rivers, deserts, and cities          
GA BMWFM           
It has people who are proud of their heritage and identity           
GA BMWFM            
And it has a lot to offer to humanity
