Sure, I can write lyrics and chords to a song about the 2020 United States presidential election and solar power in the style of They Might be Giants. Here is my attempt:

```markdown
E             A         C#m        B
It was a year of chaos and confusion
E             A         C#m        B
A pandemic, protests and pollution
E             A         C#m        B
But there was also something bright and shiny
E             A         C#m        B
A source of hope and energy: solar power

E             A         B          A
Solar power (power), it's not a fantasy
E             A         B          A
Solar power (power), it's a reality
E             A         B          A
Solar power (power), it can save the world
E             A         B          A 
Solar power (power), it's for every boy and girl

C#m            G#m       F#m        E 
The sun is a mass of incandescent gas 
C#m            G#m       F#m        E 
A gigantic nuclear furnace that gives us light and heat 
C#m            G#m       F#m        E 
But we don't have to burn fossil fuels to use it 
C#m            G#m       F#m        E 
We can harness its rays with panels and turbines 

E             A         B          A
Solar power (power), it's not a fantasy
E             A         B          A
Solar power (power), it's a reality
E             A         B          A
Solar power (power), it can save the world
E             A         B          A 
Solar power (power), it's for every boy and girl

B              C#
But not everyone was on board with this idea 
B              C#
Some people wanted to keep things as they were 
B              C#
They said that solar power was too expensive or unreliable 
B              C#
They said that coal and oil were still preferable 

A              E        F#m       D  
They might be wrong, they might be right 
A              E        F#m       D  
They might be in the dark, they might be in the light 
A              E        F#m       D  
They might be wise, they might be fools 
A              E        F#m       D  
They might be breaking all the rules 

G              D        Em        C  
So we had an election to decide our fate 
G              D        Em        C  
We had to choose between two candidates 
G              D        Em        C  
One was for solar power and the other was not 
G              D        Em        C  
One was for progress and the other was not 

D              G        
Who would win? Who would lose? 
D              G        
Who would make the news? 

Em            Am       D           G   
It was a close race, it was a nail-biter 
Em            Am       D           G   
It was a thriller, it was like The Twilight Saga (film series) [^4^]
Em            Am       D           G   
It took days and weeks to count all the votes [^1^]
Em            Am       D           G   
It took lawsuits and recounts to settle all the disputes [^2^]

C               G        
But in the end, there was a winner [^3^]
C               G        
And there was also a loser 

Am            Em       
And we all know who they are 

G              D        
So let's sing along 

G             D         Em         C  
Solar power (power), it's not a fantasy [^5^]
G             D         Em         C  
Solar power (power), it's a reality 
G             D         Em         C  
Solar power (power), it can save the world 
G             D         
Solar power (power)

[Outro] x4

Em    Am    Em    Am    
Power! Power! Power! Power!
