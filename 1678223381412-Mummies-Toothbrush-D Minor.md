Here is a song I wrote for you:

```markdown
Dm A Bb F
There's a mummy in my closet
Dm A Bb F
He's been there since last Halloween
Dm A Bb F
He likes to watch The Godfather
Dm A Bb F
And he brushes his teeth with pastry cream

Bb F Dm C
But he's not so bad, he's just lonely
Bb F Dm C
He needs a friend to share his dreams
Bb F Dm C
So I gave him my old toothbrush 
Bb F Dm C 
And we sing this song in harmony

Dm C Bb A 
We are mummies and toothbrushes 
Dm C Bb A 
We don't care what people say 
Dm C Bb A 
We have fun in our own way 
Dm C Bb A 
We are mummies and toothbrushes 

Dm A Bb F 
One day we went to the museum 
Dm A Bb F 
To see his ancient family 
Dm A Bb F 
But they were all wrapped up in glass cases 
Dm A Bb F  
And they looked so sad and dusty 

Bb F Dm C  
So we decided to break them free  
Bb F Dm C  
And take them home with us to play  
Bb F Dm C  
We bought some pastry brushes for them  
Bb F Dm C  
And we taught them how to brush their teeth 

Dm C Bb A  
We are mummies and toothbrushes   
Dm C Bb A   
We don't care what people say   
Dm C Bb A   
We have fun in our own way   
Dm C Bb A   
We are mummies and toothbrushes   

Bridge: 

G G G G G G G G (spoken)  
But then one night, something terrible happened  
The police came knocking at our door  
They said they had a warrant for our arrest  
For stealing priceless artifacts from the museum floor  

F E D E (sung)   
We tried to run but it was too late   
F E D E    
They handcuffed us and took us away    
F E D E    
They said we had to pay for our crimes    
F E D E    
And they locked us up for a long long time    

Chorus: 

A# G# D# C#     
But we're still mummies and toothbrushes     
A# G# D# C#       
We don't care what people say       
A# G# D# C#
We have fun in our own way       
A# G# D# C#
We are mummies and toothbrushes       

Outro: 

A# G# (repeat until fade out)      
Mummies and toothbrushes      
Mummies and toothbrushes      
Mummies and toothbrushes
