Here is a song parody about The Simpsons Movie in the style of They Might be Giants that I generated for you:

```
Verse 1:
Bm   G    D    A
Homer has a new pet pig
Bm   G    D    A
He loves him more than Marge or kids
Bm   G    D    A
But he dumps his waste in the lake
Bm   G    D    A
And causes an environmental mistake

Chorus:
F#m  Bm   Em   A
Now Springfield is under a dome
F#m  Bm   Em   A
And everyone blames Homer alone
F#m  Bm   Em   A
They have to escape from their home
F#m  Bm   Em   A
Before they are crushed by Cargill's drone

Verse 2:
Bm   G    D    A
The Simpsons flee to Alaska 
Bm   G    D    A 
Where they see a movie with Tom Hanks 
Bm   G    D    A 
But Marge gets a message from Lisa 
Bm   G    D    A 
Saying they have to save their town from Cargill's plans 

Chorus:
F#m  Bm   Em   A 
Now Springfield is under a dome 
F#m  Bm   Em   A 
And everyone blames Homer alone 
F#m  Bm   Em   A 
They have to escape from their home 
F#m  Bm   Em   A 
Before they are crushed by Cargill's drone 

Bridge:
D     F#
Homer doesn't want to go back 
G      E7  
He says he doesn't care about that  
D     F#
But Marge leaves him with Maggie  
G      E7  
And takes Bart and Lisa with her  

Verse 3:
Bm     G      D       A   
Homer feels sad and lonely  
Bm     G      D       A   
He meets an Inuit shaman lady  
Bm     G      D       A   
She shows him an epiphany  
Bm     G      D       A   
He decides to save his family  

Chorus:
F# m B m E m A   
Now Springfield is under a dome  
F # m B m E mA   
And everyone blames Homer alone  
F # m B m E mA   
They have to escape from their home  
F # m B m E mA   
Before they are crushed by Cargill's drone  

Outro:
D        F#
Homer rides on a motorcycle  
G        E7    
With Spider Pig behind him  
D        F#
He throws a bomb at the dome  
G        E7    
And breaks it into pieces  

D         F#
The town is saved by Homer's act  
G         E7    
Cargill is defeated by Bart's slingshot  
D         F#
The Simpsons hug and make up fast  
G         E7    
They sing along with The Beatles' song  

D          F#
All you need is love (love) (love) (love)...
