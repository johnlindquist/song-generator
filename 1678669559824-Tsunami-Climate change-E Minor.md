Okay, I'll try my best to compose a song for you. Here it is:

```markdown
Verse 1:
Em    C     G
Jordan loves to travel
Em    C     G
He wants to see the world
Em    C     G
He collects all kinds of flags
Em    C     G
From every country he explores

Chorus:
G     D     Am   Bm
But there's one flag that he adores
G     D     Am   Bm
The one that makes his heart soar
G     D     Am   Bm
It's the flag of Afghanistan 
G     D     Am   Bm
With its black, red, and green bands

Verse 2:
Em    C      G 
He met a girl named Bamboo Steamer 
Em    C      G 
She was from China, he was a dreamer 
Em    C      G 
They fell in love under her flag 
Em    C      G 
With its yellow stars and red rag 

Chorus:
G     D     Am   Bm
But there's one flag that he adores 
G     D     Am   Bm
The one that makes his heart soar 
G     D     Am   Bm
It's the flag of Afghanistan 
G     D     Am   Bm
With its black, red, and green bands 

Verse 3:
Em    C       G  
He left her for a pair of headphones 
Em    C       G  
They were from Japan, they had a nice tone 
Em    C       G  
They played music under his flag 
Em    C       G  
With its white field and red dot 

Chorus:
G     D      Am  Bm
But there's one flag that he adores 
G     D      Am  Bm
The one that makes his heart soar 
G      D      Am  Bm   
It's the flag of Afghanistan   
G      D      Am  Bm   
With its black, red, and green bands   

Bridge:   
Am        Em        F         Em   
Then he saw a quasar in the sky    
Am        Em        F         Em    
It was from outer space, it caught his eye    
Am        Em        F         Em    
It had colors like a rainbow     
Am        Em        F         Em    
It made him feel so low    

Verse 4:    
Em       C          G     
He realized he was wrong     
Em       C          G     
He had been chasing flags for too long     
Em       C          G     
He missed Bamboo Steamer and her smile     
Em       C          G     
He wanted to go back to her for a while    

Chorus:    
G       D         Am   Bm      
But there's one flag that he adores      
G       D         Am   Bm      
The one that makes his heart soar      
G       D         Am   Bm      
It's the flag of Afghanistan       
G       D         Am   Bm      
With its black, red, and green bands       

Outro:    
C           Em           F            Em         
So he packed his bags and took a flight       
C           Em           F            Em         
He hoped she would forgive him for his plight       
C           Em           F            Em         
He brought her a gift from Vatican City        
C           Em           F            Em         
A small flag with yellow and white pretty        

Coda:        
F             E             A             E          
And they lived happily ever after             
F             E             A             E          
Under the flag of Moldova             
F             E             A             E          
With its blue, yellow, and red colors             
F             E             A             E          
And its coat of arms with an eagle and an ox           
```

I hope you like it. ðŸ˜Š
