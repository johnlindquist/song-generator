But he also has one more secret that he doesn't want to tell    
Am               Dm          E7          A7    
He's in love with a girl who lives in another country    
Am               Dm          E7          A7    
She loves flags as much as him and they met online    
Am               Dm          E7          A7    
She sent him her picture with the San Marino flag behind    

Dm               E7         A7         Dm     
So he sings this song to himself when he feels alone

And maybe someday she will be his wife
