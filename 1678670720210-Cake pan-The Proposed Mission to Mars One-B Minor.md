This is a song I composed for you. It's called "Flags of the World". I hope you like it!

Verse 1:
Bm   G    D    A
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel
Bm   G    D    A
He wanted to see every flag unfurl
Bm   G    D    A
He packed his bags and flew across the ocean
Bm   G    D    A
To start his journey around the world

Chorus:
Bm   G    D    F#
Flags of the world, flags of the world
Bm   G    D    F#
Show me your colors, shapes, and symbols
Bm   G    D    F#
Flags of the world, flags of the world
Bm   G    D     F#
Tell me your stories, hopes, and dreams

Verse 2:
Bm   G     D     A
His first stop was Kuwait, where he met a girl named Layla
Bm   G     D     A
She showed him her flag with pride and joy
Bm   G     D     A 
It had black, green, red, and white 
Bm   G      D      A 
And a trapezoid on its side 
Bm   G      D      A 
She said it stood for unity and peace 
Bm  G       D       A 
And their struggle for independence

(Repeat chorus)

Verse 3:
Bm  G      D       A 
Next he went to Bosnia and Herzegovina 
Bm  G      D       A 
Where he met a boy named Amir 
Bm  G      D       A  
He showed him his flag with stars and stripes 
Bm  G      D       A  
And a yellow triangle on its right 
Bm  G      D       A  
He said it represented their diversity and harmony 
Bm  G      D       A  
And their aspiration for Europe

(Repeat chorus)

Verse 4:
 Bm  G      D        A  
Then he flew to Bhutan where he met a girl named Tashi 
 Bm  G      D        A  
She showed him her flag with orange and yellow 
 Bm  G      D        A   
And a dragon in the middle 
 Bm  G      D        A   
She said it symbolized their culture and tradition 
 Bm  G      D        A   
And their protection by their king 

(Repeat chorus)

But Jordan was not satisfied with just seeing flags

They became friends and swam together every day   
D           E           F#           Abdim7   
She taught him how to dive and splash in her own way   
D           E           F#           Abdim7   
She said she was lonely and needed someone like him   
D           E            F#            Abdim7     
To keep her company in her watery kingdom
