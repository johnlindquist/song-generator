Here is the song I composed for you:

```markdown
Bm   D   G   A   D   G
Jordan is a boy who loves geography
Bm   D   G   A   D   G
He knows all the flags of every country
Bm    D    G    A    D    G
He dreams of flying over the Indian Ocean
Bm     D     G     A     D     G
And landing in Andorra for his birthday motion

F#m  Bm  Em  F#
Levitation, levitation
F#m  Bm  Em  F#
Jordan's special celebration
F#m  Bm  Em  F#
He can float above the ground
F#m       Bm      Em      F#
With his flag collection all around

Bm    D    G    A    D    G
Jordan has a cake with eleven candles
Bm      D      G      A      D      G
He blows them out and makes a wish so gentle
Bm       D       G       A       D       G 
He wants to see the world and all its wonders 
Bm        D        G        A        D        G 
But he doesn't have a plane or a car to wander

F#m  Bm  Em  F#
Levitation, levitation
F#m  Bm  Em  F#
Jordan's special celebration
F#m  Bm  Em  F#
He can float above the ground 
F#m       Bm      Em      F#
With his flag collection all around

Bb5 C5 Eb5 Ab5 C5 Eb5 (Bridge)
Suddenly he feels a strange sensation 
Bb5 C5 Eb5 Ab5 C5 Eb5 
He lifts off his chair and starts to rise 
Bb5 C5 Eb5 Ab5 C5 Eb5 
He grabs his flags and waves them in the air 
Bb5 C5 Eb5 Ab5 C5 Eb6 (hold)  
He's levitating high up in the sky 

Gbm Db Ab Db Ab Db (Key change)
Jordan is amazed by what he sees below him 
Gbm Db Ab Db Ab Db 
The mountains and the valleys and the sea 
Gbm Db Ab Db Ab Db  
He flies across the ocean to Andorra  
Gbm Db Ab Db Ab Db  
Where he meets some friendly people who adore him 

Eb7sus4 Absus2 Bsus4 Csus2 (Chorus variation)
Levitation, levitation  
Eb7sus4 Absus2 Bsus4 Csus2  
Jordan's special celebration  
Eb7sus4 Absus2 Bsus4 Csus2  
He can float above the ground  
Eb7sus4 Absus2 Bsus4 Csus2 (hold)   
With his flag collection all around  

Abmaj7 (End on this chord)   
Levitation!
