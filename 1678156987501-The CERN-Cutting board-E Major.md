Here is a song I wrote for you:

E             C#m
The CERN is a place where they
A              B
Smash particles all day
E             C#m
They hope to find some answers to
A              B
The mysteries of space

C#m            A
But one day something went wrong
E              B
A portal opened wide
C#m            A
And out came a cutting board 
E              B 
With flowers by its side

    A             G#m 
    It was a strange sight to behold 
    E              B 
    A wooden slab with petals 
    A             G#m 
    It said "Hello, I'm from another world 
    E              B 
    Where things are made of metal"

Chorus:
B             A  
The cutting board from outer space 
E              B  
It came to share its wisdom 
B             A  
It told them all about its race 
E              B  
And how they lived in freedom 

B             A  
The scientists were amazed and thrilled 
E              B  
They asked it many questions 
B             A  
But soon they found out it was skilled 
E              B  
In causing mass destruction 

Verse 2:
E             C#m
The cutting board revealed its plan 
A              B  
To conquer planet Earth 
E             C#m
It said "You humans are so weak 
A              B  
You don't know what you're worth"

C#m            A  
It used its flowers as a weapon 
E              B  
They shot out laser beams 
C#m            A  
It destroyed the CERN facility 
E              B  
And laughed at their screams 

    A             G#m   
    It said "I'm not alone in this mission   
    E              B   
    I have some allies here   
    A             G#m   
    They're hiding at the Jodrell Bank Observatory   
    E              B   
    And they will soon appear"   

Chorus:
B             A    
The cutting board from outer space    
E              B    
It came to share its wisdom    
B             A    
It told them all about its race    
E              B    
And how they lived in freedom    

B             A    
The scientists were amazed and thrilled    
E              B    
They asked it many questions    
B             A    
But soon they found out it was skilled    
E              B    
In causing mass destruction    

Bridge:
F#m           G#m     
But then a hero rose up from the crowd     
A               E     
He grabbed a guitar and played it loud     
F#m           G#m     
He sang a song that made the cutting board cry     
A               E     
He said "You may be strong but you can't deny     

Chorus:
B             A      
That we are humans and we have a heart      
E              B      
We love each other even when we're apart      
B             A      
We have a spirit that you can't erase      
E (let ring)   (no chord)       
We won't give up to the cutting board from outer space"
