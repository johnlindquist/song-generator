I'm happy to help you with your request. Here is a song I wrote about Titanic (1953 film) and Jaws (film) in the style of They Might be Giants. I hope you enjoy it!

```
Verse 1:
Gm
Julia was unhappy with her life among the rich
Dm
She took her kids and boarded on a ship that had a glitch
Eb
Richard followed them and bought a ticket from a Basque
D7
He wanted to convince her to come back and make it last

Chorus:
Gm
But little did they know that there was danger in the sea
Eb
A giant shark was lurking underneath their destiny
Dm
It had a taste for human flesh and didn't care for class
D7 
It only wanted to devour everything that passed

Verse 2:
Gm 
The ship was sailing smoothly and the people were at ease
Dm 
They danced and drank and gambled as they crossed the seven seas
Eb 
But then one night they hit an iceberg that they didn't see
D7 
And soon they realized they had to face their tragedy

Chorus:
Gm 
But little did they know that there was danger in the sea
Eb 
A giant shark was lurking underneath their destiny
Dm 
It had a taste for human flesh and didn't care for class
D7 
It only wanted to devour everything that passed

Bridge:
Cm 
The shark was getting closer as the ship began to sink
F7 
It smelled the blood and panic of the people on the brink
Bb 
It opened up its jaws and started biting left and right
G7 
It didn't care if they were young or old or black or white

Verse 3:
Gm 
Julia and Richard tried to save their children's lives
Dm 
They put them on a lifeboat with some dishes and some knives  
Eb  
They hugged them and they kissed them and they said their last goodbyes  
D7  
They hoped that they would make it to the shore before sunrise  

Chorus:  
Gm  
But little did they know that there was danger in the sea  
Eb  
A giant shark was lurking underneath their destiny  
Dm  
It had a taste for human flesh and didn't care for class  
D7   
It only wanted to devour everything that passed  

Outro:   
Cm F7 Bb G7 Cm F7 Bb G7   
Jaws, jaws, jaws, jaws...
