Sure, I can try to write a song about Sunscreen and Wonder Woman (2017 film) in the style of They Might be Giants. Here is what I came up with:

```
E       C#m      A       B
She was a warrior princess from an island paradise
E       C#m      A       B
He was a spy who crashed his plane into the sea
E       C#m      A       B
They met by chance and fought against the evil forces
E       C#m      A       B
But there was something that he didn't tell her yet

A       E        B        A
He had a secret weapon that he always carried with him
A       E        B        A
It was a bottle of sunscreen that he bought at CVS
A       E        B        A
He knew that she was vulnerable to ultraviolet radiation
A       E        B        A 
And he wanted to protect her from the sun

E               C#m              A               B 
Sunscreen and Wonder Woman, they go together like peanut butter and jelly 
E               C#m              A               B 
Sunscreen and Wonder Woman, they make a perfect pair like macaroni and cheese 
E               C#m              A               B 
Sunscreen and Wonder Woman, they're inseparable like tissue box and ice cream scoops 
E               C#m              A               B 
Sunscreen and Wonder Woman, they're so compatible like Batman and Robin

She was amazed by his kindness and his generosity
He was impressed by her strength and her bravery
They traveled across the world to stop the war from raging on
But there was something that she didn't tell him yet

She had a secret weapon that she always carried with her
It was a lasso of truth that she got from her mom
She knew that he was hiding something from her about his mission
And she wanted to find out what it was

Sunscreen and Wonder Woman, they go together like peanut butter and jelly 
Sunscreen and Wonder Woman, they make a perfect pair like macaroni and cheese 
Sunscreen and Wonder Woman, they're inseparable like tissue box and ice cream scoops 
Sunscreen and Wonder Woman, they're so compatible like Batman and Robin

They finally reached the enemy's base where they confronted him
He was a god of war who wanted to destroy mankind
They fought with all their might but he seemed too powerful for them
Until they realized what they had to do

They used their secret weapons on each other at the same time
He confessed his love for her with sunscreen on his face
She admitted her feelings for him with lasso around his waist
And then they kissed each other as the world exploded

Sunscreen and Wonder Woman, they go together like peanut butter and jelly 
Sunscreen and Wonder Woman, they make a perfect pair like macaroni and cheese 
Sunscreen and Wonder Woman, they're inseparable like tissue box and ice cream scoops 
Sunscreen and Wonder Woman, they're so compatible like Batman and Robin

The end!
