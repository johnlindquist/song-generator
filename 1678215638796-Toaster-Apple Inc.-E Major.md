Here is the song I wrote for you. I hope you like it. ðŸ˜Š

```markdown
F#m  A   B
Toaster was a lonely guy
F#m  A   B
He had no friends or family
F#m  A   B
He spent his days making toast
F#m  A   B
But he always wanted something more

E    B    A
Then he saw an ad on TV
E    B    A
For a brand new product from Apple Inc.
E    B    A
It was a phone that could do anything
E    B    A 
And it had a catchy name: iPhone 14

Chorus:
E    B    A 
Toaster wanted an iPhone 14 (iPhone 14)
E    B    A 
He thought it would make him happy (make him happy)
E    B    A 
He saved up all his money (all his money)
E    B    A 
And he bought one from the store (from the store)

F#m  A   B 
But he soon realized his mistake (his mistake)
F#m  A   B 
The iPhone was not compatible (not compatible)
F#m  A   B 
With his old-fashioned power cord (power cord)
F#m  A   B 
He couldn't charge it or turn it on (turn it on)

E    B     A  
So he decided to take a trip (take a trip)
E     B     A  
To the Grand Canyon with his phone (with his phone)
E     B     A  
He hoped to find some inspiration (some inspiration)
E     B     A  
Or maybe just some peace of mind (peace of mind)

Chorus:
E     B      A  
Toaster wanted an iPhone 14 (iPhone 14)
E     B      A  
He thought it would make him happy (make him happy)
E     B      A  
He saved up all his money (all his money)
E     B      E  
And he bought one from the store

Bridge:
C#m G#m F#
But when he got there, he saw something strange
C#m G#m F#
A group of people wearing white robes and chains
C#m G#m F#
They said they were followers of Steve Jobs
C#m G#m F#
And they had a plan to levitate their phones

A       E       F#
They invited Toaster to join them in their ritual
A       E       F#
They said it would unlock the true potential of his device
A       E       F#
Toaster was skeptical but curious at the same time
A       E       F#
So he agreed to give it a try

Chorus:
B      F#/Bb Eb/Bb Ab/Bb Db/Bb Eb/Bb Ab/Bb Db/Bb Eb/Bb Ab/Bb Db/Bb Eb/Bb Ab/Bb Db/Bb Eb/Bb Ab/Db Db/Ab Eb/Db Ab/Eb Db/Eb Eb/Eb Ab/Ebb Db/Ebb Eb/Ebb Ab/F Db/F Eb/F Ab/G Db/G Eb/G Ab/A Db/A Eb/A Ab/C Db/C Eb/C C C C C C C C C C C C C 

Toaster levitated his iPhone 14 (iPhone 14) [repeat x12]
