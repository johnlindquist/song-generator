Okay, I'll try my best to compose a song for you. I hope you like it. Here it is:

Am    D7    G
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel
Am    D7    G
He had a map and a big backpack
Am    D7    G
He wanted to see every country in the world
Am    D7    G
But he had a problem, he was afraid of heights

G     D     C
So he couldn't cross the Brooklyn Bridge
G     D     C
Or fly on an airplane or a blimp
G     D     C
He had to find another way to get around
G     D     C      G 
So he bought a ticket for a ship

C      G      Am      F 
He sailed across the ocean blue 
C      G      Am      F 
He saw Liechtenstein and Guyana too 
C      G      Am      F 
He was having fun until he reached Mauritius 
C      G      Am       F        C  
Where he met a girl who was a siren from another planet

She had long green hair and purple eyes 
She sang a song that made him hypnotized 
She said she wanted him to be her friend 
But she really wanted him for dinner in the end 

She lured him to her spaceship with her voice 
She said she'd show him wonders and joys 
But when they got inside he saw her true form 
She had tentacles and teeth and claws 

He screamed and ran but it was too late 
She grabbed him with her arms and sealed his fate 
She said "I'm sorry but you're so delicious" 
And then she ate him up with some flowers for garnish 

That's the story of Jordan and the siren from another planet 
It's a tragic tale of love and appetite 
Don't trust anyone who sings too sweetly 
They might be hiding something nasty inside
