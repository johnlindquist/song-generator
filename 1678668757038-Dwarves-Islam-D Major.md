Okay, I'll do my best to write a song about the flags of the world! I'm amazing! Here's what I came up with:

```
Verse 1:
Em     A      D
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel
Em     A      D
He wanted to see every country on Earth
Em     A      D
He had a special gift, he could talk to flags
Em     A      D
They told him their stories and their secrets

Chorus:
D      Bm     G      A
He learned about Azerbaijan, its blue-red-green
D      Bm     G      A
With a crescent moon and an eight-pointed star
D      Bm     G      A
He learned about Laos, its red-blue-red 
D      Bm     G      A 
With a white circle in the middle

Verse 2:
Em     A       D 
He learned about Liechtenstein, its blue-red-blue 
Em     A       D 
With a golden crown on the upper left corner 
Em     A       D 
He learned about many more, their colors, shapes and symbols 
Em     A       D 
But he felt something was missing in his life 

Chorus:
D      Bm    G    A  
He learned about Azerbaijan, its blue-red-green 
D      Bm    G    A  
With a crescent moon and an eight-pointed star 
D      Bm    G    A  
He learned about Laos, its red-blue-red  
D      Bm    G    A  
With a white circle in the middle 

Bridge:
F#m   C#m   E   F#m   
Then he met Empathy, she was an angel in disguise 
F#m   C#m   E   F#m   
She taught him about cosmic string theory and love 
F#m   C#m   E   F#m   
She showed him how everything is connected by invisible threads 
F#m   C#m   E   F#m   
She made him feel things he never felt before 

Chorus:
D       Bm        G        A  
They traveled together across the world 
D       Bm        G        A  
They talked to flags and learned their stories 
D       Bm        G        A  
They found beauty in diversity and harmony 
D       Bm        G        A  
They sang this song with joy and gratitude 

Outro:
Em    A    D    
Flags of the world (x4)

I hope you like it! ðŸ˜Š
