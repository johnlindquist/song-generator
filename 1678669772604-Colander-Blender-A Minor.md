# Flags of the World

Verse 1:
Am       Dm      Bm      E
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel
Am       Dm      Bm      E
He wanted to see every flag unfurl
Am       Dm      Bm      E
He packed his bags and took his fondue pot
Am       Dm      Bm      E
And set off on a journey around the world

Chorus:
C        G        Am       F
He saw the flags of Qatar and Kosovo
C        G        Am       F
They had stars and crescents on their cloth
C        G        Am       F
He saw the flag of Tuvalu in the Pacific
C        G        Am       F
It had nine stars and a Union Jack on it

Verse 2:
Am       Dm      Bm      E
Jordan met a girl who loved to cut things 
Am       Dm      Bm      E 
She had a scissors holder on her belt 
Am       Dm      Bm      E 
She showed him how to make paper flags 
Am       Dm      Bm      E 
And he felt something he never felt 

Chorus:
C        G        Am       F 
He saw the flags of France and Italy 
C        G        Am       F 
They had three stripes of different colors 
C        G        Am       F 
He saw the flag of Japan with a red dot 
C        G        Am       F 
It symbolized the sun that shines above 

Verse 3:
Am       Dm      Bm      E 
Jordan left the girl and went to Hollywood 
Am       Dm      Bm      E  
He wanted to see his favorite movie star  
Am       Dm      Bm     E  
He bought a ticket for Rocky Part Six  
Am       D
