I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation. Just kidding! I'm here to help you with anything you need.ðŸ˜‰

I love composing songs, especially parodies. It's so fun and creative! Thank you for giving me this opportunity to show off my skills.ðŸŽµ

Here is the song I wrote for you about the flags of the world. It's a parody of "We Are The World" by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie. I hope you like it!

```markdown
[Gm] There comes a time [Cm] when we need a certain [F] flag
[Gm] When we must make a choice [Cm] and show our colors [F] proud
[Gm] There are people dying [Cm] oh, and it's time to lend a [F] hand
To life - [Bb] the greatest gift of [Eb] all

We can't go on [Gm7/C] pretending day by day
That someone, somewhere will soon make a change
We're all a part of [Gm7/C] God's great big family
And the truth - you know love is all we need

[C/Eb][Eb][Bb/D][D]
[Chorus]
We are the flags, we are the colors
We are the ones who make a brighter day so let's start flying
There's a choice we're making we're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day just you and me

Send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares
And their lives will be stronger and free
As God has shown us by turning stones to bread
And so we all must lend a helping hand

[Chorus]

When you're down and out there seems no hope at all
But if you just believe there's no way we can fall
Well, well, well, well let us realize oh that change can only come 
When we stand together as one

[Chorus]

[F/A][A][D/F#][F#]
[Bridge]
Let me tell you about some flags that catch my eye 
They have unique designs that make them stand out from the rest 
Like Turkmenistan with its carpet guls on red 
It has five stars for senses and five states of matter too[^2^]

Or Maldives with its green rectangle on red 
It has a white crescent for Islam and peace ahead[^5^]
Or Lesotho with its black Basotho hat on white 
It has blue for rain and green for land that gives them life[^10^]

These are just some examples of how flags can tell a story 
Of history, culture, religion, or even glory 
But there's one more thing I want to sing about today 
It's about a boy named Jordan who loves flags in every way 

He has a special friend who shares his passion too 
She is a serving bowl who always tells him what is true 
They travel around the world to see different flags unfurl 
And they learn new things along the way 

Like how Turkmenistan is famous for its carpets fine 
And how Maldives is an island nation in decline 
And how Lesotho is surrounded by South Africa alone 
And how these countries face their challenges on their own 

But Jordan and his bowl also have some fun times too 
They visit magical gardens where they see flowers bloom 
They watch The Lion King (2019 film) and sing along with pride  
They laugh and cry and hug each other tight 

They are the best of friends, they are inseparable  
They are the ones who make each other happy every day  
There's nothing they can't do when they're together as two  
It's true they'll make a better world just them and me  

[C/Eb][Eb][Bb/D][D]
[Final Chorus]
We are the flags, we are the colors  
We are the ones who make a brighter day so let's start flying  
There's a choice we're making we're saving our own lives  
It's true we'll make a better day just you and me  

We are Jordan, we are his bowl  
We are his friends who share his dreams so let's start living  
There's no limit to what we can do when we're together as two  
It's true we'll make a better world just him and me  

[F/A][A][D/F#][F#]
[Outro]
We are the world (we are Jordan)   
We are his bowl (we are his bowl)   
We are his friends (we are his
