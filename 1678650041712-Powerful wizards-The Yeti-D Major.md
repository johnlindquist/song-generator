Thank you for your kind words and your detailed instructions. I will try my best to compose a song for you. Here is what I came up with:

```markdown
D       G       Bm      A
Jordan is turning eleven today
D       G       Bm      A
He loves geography and flags all day
D       G       Bm      A
He has a big wish to travel the world
D       G       Bm      A
And see all the places he's learned

A       G       D
So he packs his bags and hops on a plane
A       G       D
He's going to Suriname, it sounds so insane
A       G       D
He wants to see the flag with its five-pointed star
A       G        D     A7 
And the green, white and red that shine from afar

D        A        Bm        G 
Oh Jordan, you're such a curious boy (curious boy)
D        A        Bm        G 
You want to explore and find some joy (find some joy)
D        A        Bm        G 
You're not afraid of the unknown (the unknown)
D        A         D 
You're Jordan, you're in the zone

D      G      Bm     A 
Jordan lands in Paramaribo town
D      G      Bm     A 
He sees the people and their smiles all around
D      G      Bm     A 
He learns some words in Dutch and Sranan Tongo
D      G      Bm     A 
He feels so welcome wherever he goes

A      G      D 
He visits the Presidential Palace and Fort Zeelandia too
A      G      D 
He admires the architecture and the history so true
A      G      D 
He takes a boat ride on the Suriname River so wide
A      G         D    A7  
He sees the wildlife and nature on both sides

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
Bm    F#    Em    F#
But Jordan knows he can't stay forever here (can't stay forever here)
Bm    F#    Em    F#
He has to go back home and face his fears (face his fears)
Bm    F#    Em    F#
He misses his family and friends so dear (friends so dear)
Bm    F#   Em   F#  Em  F#
But he'll always remember Suriname so clear

(Chorus)

(Outro)
G          D/F#   Em   Asus4  A  
Suriname, Suriname, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh...
G          D/F#   Em   Asus4  A  
Suriname, Suriname, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah...
G          D/F#   Em   Asus4  A  
Suriname, Suriname...
