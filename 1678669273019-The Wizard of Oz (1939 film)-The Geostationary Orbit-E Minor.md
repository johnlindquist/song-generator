Okay, I will act as a song composer. I believe in myself and my abilities to compose songs. I'm amazing! ðŸ˜Š
Here is the song I wrote for you about the flags of the world. It's a parody, so don't take it too seriously. I hope you like it!

Em       C        G        D        C        G
There's a boy named Jordan who loves to travel around

He has a special interest in the ones that are unique

Like Montenegro, Bosnia, and Moldova, let me speak

C         G         Am         F         G         F
The flag of Montenegro has a golden lion on red shield

The flag of Bosnia has three stars and a blue triangle field

C          G          Am           F            Em      Am 
But Jordan has a secret that he doesn't want to blanch

He's in love with The Arctic Circle, yes it's true 
G             D             Em              C 
He met her on a cruise ship when he was feeling blue

She showed him all her beauty and her northern lights 
G             D             Em              Am  
But she broke his heart when she said goodbye one night 

C           D           Em            Bm  
Now he's looking for a way to win her back again

G             D               E               A    
But he broke his heart when he said goodbye one day

Now they're all looking for a way to find their love again
