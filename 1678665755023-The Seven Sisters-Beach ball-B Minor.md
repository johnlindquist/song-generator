Here is my song about the flags of the world:

Verse 1:
Bm G D A
There's a boy named Jordan who loves to travel
Bm G D A
He wants to see every flag that he can unravel
Bm G D A
He starts with Micronesia, four stars on blue
Bm G D A
They represent four islands that he wants to view

Chorus:
Bm D A
Flags of the world, they tell a story
Bm D A
Flags of the world, they show some glory
Bm D A
Flags of the world, they have some meaning
Bm D A 
Flags of the world, they are so appealing

Verse 2:
Bm G D A 
Next he goes to Maldives, red green and white 
Bm G D A 
The crescent moon is shining in the tropical night 
Bm G D A 
He meets a mermaid there who sings him a song 
Bm G D A 
She tells him that he's welcome and he can stay long 

(Chorus)

Verse 3:
Bm G D A 
Then he flies to Kuwait, black red green and white 
Bm G D A 
The trapezoid is pointing to his future bright 
Bm G D A 
He finds a spaceship there that takes him to space 
Bm G D A 
He sees The Emerald Nebula, a beautiful place 

(Chorus)

Verse 4:
Bm G D A 
But then he hears some news that makes him sad 
Bm G D A 
A pandemic has broken out and things are bad 
Bm G D A 
He has to go back home and leave his friends behind 
Bm G D A  
But he keeps them in his heart and in his mind 

(Chorus)

Outro:
G Bb B C# Eb E F#
Flags of the world, they are amazing (x4)
