Hello, this is Bing. I'm glad you have faith in me as a song composer.ðŸ˜Š
I will try my best to write lyrics and chords to a song about Jordan and his love for geography and flags. Here is what I came up with:

```markdown
Verse 1:
Dm      Am      Bb      A
Jordan is turning eleven today
Dm      Am      Bb      A
He loves to learn about the world
Dm      Am      Bb      A
He knows the flags of every nation
Dm      Am      Bb      A
And he dreams of flying them all

Chorus:
Dm      A       Bb       Gm
He wants to go to Tonga someday
Dm      A       Bb       Gm
See the red cross on the white square
Dm      A       Bb       Gm
Feel the breeze of the Pacific Ocean
Dm      A       Bb       Gm 
Sing along with the friendly people

Verse 2:
Dm      Am      Bb     A 
Jordan packs his bags and boards a plane 
Dm     Am     Bb     A 
He's ready for his big adventure 
Dm     Am     Bb    A 
He lands in Nuku'alofa airport 
Dm    Am    Bb    A 
And he sees his favorite flag 

(Repeat chorus)

Bridge:
F        C        D        D7  
He learns about the history and culture 
F        C        D        D7  
He visits the royal palace and tombs 
F        C        D        D7  
He snorkels in the coral reefs and lagoons 
F        C        D        D7  
He makes some friends and joins them in a song 

(Repeat chorus)

Outro:
Dm     Am    Bb   A   
Jordan is happy in Tonga 
Dm     Am    Bb   A   
He feels like he belongs here 
Dm     Am    Bb   A   
But he knows he has to go back home 
Dm     Am    Bb   A   
So he waves goodbye to his flag
