I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation. Just kidding! Here's your song:

G             D              Em            C
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel the world
G             D              Em            C
He had a passion for exploring different flags unfurled
G             D              Em            C
He liked to learn about their colors, shapes, and symbols too
G             D              Em            C
And he had a special gift that made his dreams come true

D             C              G
He could visit any place by using telepathy
D             C              G
He could see the sights and sounds without leaving his seat
D             C              G
He could talk to anyone by using his mind power
D             C              G 
He could make friends everywhere in every hour

G             D              Em            C 
One day he decided to go on a flag adventure 
G             D              Em            C 
He wanted to see some flags that were rare and obscure 
G             D              Em            C 
He closed his eyes and focused on a random destination 
G             D              Em            C 
And he found himself in Bahrain, a tiny island nation 

D             C              G  
He saw the flag of Bahrain with its red and white stripes 
D             C              G  
He learned that they symbolized peace and bloodshed in fights 
D             C              G  
He met a girl named Layla who showed him around the place 
D             C              G  
She told him about the culture, history, and faith 

(Chorus)
Em            D               G               C  
This is the song of the flags of the world (flags of the world) 
Em            D               G               C  
This is the song of their stories untold (stories untold) 
Em            D               G               C  
This is the song of their beauty and grace (beauty and grace) 
Em            D               G               Am   Bm   Am   Bm   Am   Bm   Am   Bm   
This is the song that will make your heart race (make your heart race) 

G             D              Em            C  
Jordan thanked Layla for her kindness and hospitality 
G             D              Em            C  
He gave her a hug and said goodbye with sincerity 
G             D              Em            C  
He closed his eyes again and thought of another location 
G             D              Em            C  
And he found himself in Sao Tome and Principe, an African nation 

D             C              G  
He saw the flag of Sao Tome with its green, yellow, red, and black 
D             C              G  
He learned that they represented nature, wealth, blood, and hope intact 
D             C              G  
He met a boy named Mateus who took him to an enchanted forest 
D             C              G  
He showed him some magical creatures that were friendly and gorgeous 

(Chorus)

G
