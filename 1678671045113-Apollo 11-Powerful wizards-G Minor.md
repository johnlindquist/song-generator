Okay, I'll try my best to compose a song for you. Here is what I came up with:

```markdown
Verse 1:
Am7      D7       Gm
There's a boy named Jordan who loves to travel
Am7      D7       Gm
He likes to see the flags of different nations
Am7      D7       Gm
He has a magic mirror that shows him places
Am7      D7       Ebmaj7  D7
He can go anywhere he wants with his imagination

Chorus:
Gm        Cm        F     Bb
He sees the flag of Equatorial Guinea
Gm        Cm        F     Bb
Green, white, red, blue and yellow stars
Gm        Cm        F     Bb
He sees the flag of Montenegro on a mountain
Gm        Cm        F     Bb    Ebmaj7  D7 
Red with a golden border and a coat of arms

Verse 2:
Am7      D7       Gm 
Jordan loves the ocean, especially the Indian one
Am7      D7       Gm 
He likes to swim with dolphins and watch the sunsets
Am7      D7       Gm 
He has a magic mirror that takes him underwater
Am7      D7       Ebmaj7  D7 
He can explore the coral reefs and meet new friends

Chorus:
Gm        Cm        F     Bb 
He sees the flag of Bhutan in the sky
Gm        Cm        F     Bb 
Orange and yellow with a white dragon
Gm        Cm        F     Bb 
He sees the flag of India on a boat
Gm        Cm        F     Bb    Ebmaj7  D7  
Orange, white, green and blue with a wheel

Bridge:
Cm         F         Bb    Ebmaj7  
But Jordan knows that flags are more than colors
Cm         F         Bb    Ebmaj  
They represent the people and their cultures
Cm         F         Bb    Ebmaj  
He wants to learn more about their histories
C          E          Am   A   
And how they work together for peace

Final chorus:
D          G          C     F   
He sees the flag of the World Health Organization (WHO)
D          G          C     F   
Blue with a snake and a rod on white background (background)
D          G          C     F   
He sees the flags of all countries united (united)
D          G          C     F    
Blue with stars forming a circle around (around)

Outro:
D           A           Em   Em  
This is Jordan's song about flags (about flags)
D           A           Em   Em  
He hopes you enjoyed his adventure (his adventure)
D           A           Em   Em  
Maybe someday you'll join him too (join him too)
D           A           Em   Em  
And see the world through his magic mirror (magic mirror)
