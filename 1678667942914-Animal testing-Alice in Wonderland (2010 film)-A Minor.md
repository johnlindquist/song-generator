Wow, that's quite a challenge! But I love composing songs, so I'll give it a try. Here's what I came up with:

```markdown
Am          F           C           G
Jordan was a boy who loved the flags of the world
Am          F           C           G
He knew their colors, shapes, and symbols by heart
Am          F           C           G
He dreamed of traveling to every country he could
Am          F           C           G
And seeing the flags flying high in the sky

F            G            Am         Em
But there was one flag that caught his eye
F            G            Am         Em
The flag of Samoa, with its red and blue
F            G            Am         Em
It had a white cross and four white stars
F            G            C          E7 
And it reminded him of someone he knew

Am          F           C           G 
She was a girl who worked at the Sistine Chapel 
Am          F           C           G 
She gave tours to tourists from all over the world 
Am          F           C           G 
She had long black hair and brown eyes like bamboo 
Am          F           C           G 
And she wore a necklace with a Samoan pearl 

F            G            Am         Em 
He met her on his first trip to Rome 
F            G            Am         Em 
He fell in love with her at first sight 
F            G            Am         Em 
He wanted to ask her out but he was too shy 
F            G            C          E7  
So he bought her a ticket to see The Hunger Games that night 

Chorus: 

Dm        E7        Am       A7  
They watched Katniss fight for her life  
Dm        E7        Am       A7  
They cheered when she shot the arrow  
Dm        E7        Am       A7  
They held hands when Peeta almost died  
Dm        E7        F       E7   
They kissed when they left the theater 

Dm        E7        Am       A7  
They were happy for a while  
Dm        E7        Am       A7  
They traveled to many places together  
Dm        E7        Am       A7  
They saw the flag of Laos with its white circle   
Dm        E7        F       E7   
They ate bamboo steamer for dinner  

Bridge: 

G             D             Em             Bm   
But then one day he got a call from home   
G             D             Em             Bm   
His father was sick and he had to go back   
G             D             Em             Bm   
He promised her he would return soon   
G             D             C              A    
But he didn't know if he could keep that   

Coda: 

Am          F           C           G    
He never saw her again after that day    
Am          F           C           G    
He tried to call her but she didn't answer    
Am          F           C           G    
He wondered if she found someone else    
Am          F           C              E     
Or if she still remembered him at all    

F              G              Am               Em     
But every time he looked at his wall     
F              G              Am               Em     
Where he hung all the flags of the world     
F              G              Am               Em     
There was one flag that made him smile     
F              G              C                E      
The flag of Qatar with its maroon and white     

Outro: 

Am         F         C         (G)       
He still loved her, yes he did      
(G)      (E)      (A)      (A)       
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh      
(A)      (E)      (A)      (A)       
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh      
(A)      (E)      (A)       
Oh oh oh
