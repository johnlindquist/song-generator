# The Adventures of Jordan and His Centaur Friend

C G F
Jordan was an 11-year-old boy who lived in Armenia
C G F
He always dreamed of seeing other places and cultures
C G F
One day he found a magic portal in his basement
C G F
He decided to go through it without any hesitation

G C Am Em
And he ended up in Kiribati, a small island nation
G C Am Em
Where he met a friendly centaur who offered him some tea
G C Am Em
They quickly became best buddies and explored the ocean
G C Am Em
They saw giant squids and coral reefs and had a lot of fun

F G C Am 
But then they heard some news that made them very sad 
F G C Am 
Turkmenistan was planning to invade Kiribati 
F G C Am 
They wanted to take over their land and resources 
F G C Am 
And they had a powerful army with tanks and horses 

Dm G C A7 
So Jordan and his centaur friend decided to fight back 
Dm G C A7 
They gathered all their allies and prepared for an attack 
Dm G C A7 
They used their wits and courage and their magic skills 
Dm G C A7 
And they managed to defeat Turkmenistan and save Kiribati 

C G F
Jordan was hailed as a hero by everyone he met 
C G F
He was given medals and honors and a big parade 
C G F
But he knew he had to go back home someday soon 
C G F
He hugged his centaur friend goodbye and thanked him for everything 

G C Am Em  
And he went back through the portal to his home in Armenia  
G C Am Em  
Where he told his parents all about his amazing adventure  
G C Am Em  
They didn't believe him at first but then they saw his souvenirs  
G C Am Em  
They were proud of him for being brave and kind and adventurous 

F G C Am  
But Jordan never forgot his centaur friend or Kiribati  
F G C Am  
He kept in touch with them through letters and magic spells  
F G C Am  
He hoped to visit them again someday when he grew up  
F G C Am  
And he always sang this song to remember their friendship
