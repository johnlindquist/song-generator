Here is a song I wrote for you:

```
F G Am Em
I bought a yoga mat online
F G Am Em
It was supposed to help me unwind
F G Am Em
But when it arrived at my door
F G C C7
It was much more than I bargained for

F G Am Em
It had a label that said "Warning"
F G Am Em
"This mat can take you to new places"
F G Am Em
I thought it was just advertising
F G C C7
But then I saw it had some laces

C F C F 
So I tied them around my waist 
C F C F 
And I felt a sudden jolt 
C F C F 
The next thing I knew I was flying 
G7 C 
To the Grand Canyon on my yoga mat

Chorus:
C G Am F 
Oh, yoga mat, you're so amazing 
C G Am F 
You take me where I want to go 
C G Am F 
You're like a magic carpet ride 
G7 C 
But with more zen and less Aladdin

Verse 2:
F G Am Em
I landed on the canyon rim
F G Am Em
And I saw a group of hikers there
F G Am Em
They looked at me with disbelief
F G C C7
And asked me how I got up there

F G Am Em
I told them about my yoga mat
F G Am Em
And how it could transport me anywhere
F G Am Em
They asked me if they could try it too
F G C C7  
But then we heard a zombie bear

C F C F  
It was growling and drooling blood  
C F C F  
It had been infected by a virus  
C F C F  
We ran for our lives but it was too fast  
G7 C  
We needed some medicine or a crossbow

Chorus:
C G Am F  
Oh, yoga mat, you're our only hope  
C G Am F  
You have to get us out of here  
C G Am F  
You're like a helicopter rescue   
G7 C   
But with more calm and less noise

Bridge:
Dm Dm Dm Dm   
We jumped on the mat and held on tight   
Dm Dm Dm Dm   
We prayed that it would work again   
Dm Dm Dm Dm   
We closed our eyes and wished real hard   
G7sus4  (hold)    
And then we felt ourselves ascend  

Final chorus:    
C  (hold)    
Oh, yoga mat, you saved our lives    
G  (hold)    
You took us away from danger    
Am  (hold)    
You're like a superhero sidekick     
F  (hold)     
But with more stretch and less spandex    

Outro:     
C   (fade out)     
Yoga mat, yoga mat...
