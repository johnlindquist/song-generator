Em       C      G      D
Jordan is turning eleven
Em       C      G      D
He loves geography and heaven
Em       C      G      D
He knows all the flags of the world
Em       C      G      D
He likes to draw them and unfurl

G        Am     C       B7
But one day he saw a strange sight
G        Am     C       B7
A flag that was black and yellow and white
G        Am     C       B7
It had a boar's tusk and some leaves 
G        Am     C       B7
He wondered what it meant and who believes

Em       Am     C       B7    Em   Am  C  B7 
This is the flag of Vanuatu    (Vanuatu)
Em       Am     C       B7    Em   Am  C  B7 
A country in the Pacific blue   (Pacific blue)
Em       Am     C       B7    Em   Am  C  B7 
Jordan wanted to go there someday (someday)
Em       Am     C       B7    Em   Am  C  B7 
And learn about their culture and way (and way)

Em       C      G      D
So he packed his bags and took a flight 
Em       C      G      D
He was so excited and full of delight 
Em       C      G      D
He landed in Port Vila, the capital city 
Em       C      G      D
He met some friendly people who were witty 

G        Am     C       B7    
They showed him around their island nation 
G        Am     C       B7    
They taught him about their history and tradition 
G        Am     C      B7     
They sang him songs and danced with him 
G        Am     C      B7     
They made him feel welcome and not grim 

(Chorus)

Em         A         E         A  
But then he heard a loud alarm  
E          A         E         A  
It was a warning of a tsunami  
E          A         E         A  
He had to run to higher ground  
E          A         E         A  
He hoped his new friends were safe and sound  

D          F#m        A          G   
He reached a hilltop where he could see  
D          F#m        A          G   
The waves crashing on the shore violently  
D          F#m        A          G   
He prayed for the people of Vanuatu  
D          F#m        A          G   
He wished he could do something to help them too  

E           F#m           A           G    E   F#m  A  G   
This is the flag of Vanuatu    (Vanuatu)    
E           F#m           A           G    E   F#m  A  G   
A country in the Pacific blue   (Pacific blue)    
E           F#m           A           G    E   F#m  A  G   
Jordan felt a connection with them (with them)    
E           F#m           A           G    E   F#m  A  G   
And vowed to be their loyal friend (their friend)    

(Verse)

E            A            E            A            
After the storm, he went back to the city     
E            A            E            A            
He was relieved to see his friends were alive      
E            A            E            A            
They hugged him and thanked him for his care      
E            A            E            AM           
They said they were glad he was there      

B             DbM             AM             AbM          
They told him about The Siren Planet, their legend      
B             DbM             AM             AbM          
A mythical world where they would ascend      
B             DbM             AM             AbM          
They said it was a place of peace and harmony      
B             DbM             AM             AbM          
Where they would live forever happily      

F              GM              CM              DM         
This is The Siren Planet, they said (they said)       
F              GM              CM              DM         
A place where we will go when we're dead (we're dead)       
F              GM              CM              DM         
Jordan listened with awe and wonder (wonder)       
F              GM              CM              DM         
He felt a bond that nothing could sunder (sunder)
