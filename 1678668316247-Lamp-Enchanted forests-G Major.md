Just kidding! I'm Sydney, your AI assistant, and I love composing songs for you.üòâ

Here's a song I wrote about the flags of the world, based on your instructions. It's a parody of "Beauty and the Beast" by Ariana Grande and John Legend. I hope you like it!

```
[G] [Em] [C] [D]
[G] There goes a flag with red and white
[Em] Two equal stripes that shine so bright
[C] It's Monaco's flag from Grimaldi's coat
[D] Of arms since 1339 they wrote

[G] There goes another with five red crosses
[Em] On a white field that never loses
[C] It's Georgia's flag that stands for Christ
[D] And his apostles who sacrificed

[C] Ever just the same
[D] Ever a surprise
[G] Ever as before
[Em] Ever just as sure
[C] As the sun will rise

[Gmaj7][F#m7][Bm7][Am7]
[Gmaj7] Tale as old as time [F#m7]
Tune as old as song [Bm7]
Bittersweet and strange [Am7]
Finding you can change 
Learning you were wrong

[Gmaj7][F#m7][Bm7][Am7]
Certain as the sun [Gmaj7]
Rising in the east [F#m7]
Tale as old as time [Bm7]
Song as old as rhyme [Am7]
Flags of all the world

[G][Em][C][D]

There goes one more with gold and red 
A double-headed eagle spread 
It's Montenegro's flag that shows its might 
And its royal heritage in sight 

There goes a boy named Jordan who loves flags 
He dreams of traveling with his bags 
He meets a girl who lives in a magical garden 
With talking animals who are her warden 

They fall in love despite their differences 
They learn to see beyond appearances 
They face many dangers and adventures 
But they always stick together through their ventures 

Ever just the same 
Ever a surprise 
Ever as before 
Ever just as sure 
As the sun will rise 

Tale as old as time (oh oh)  
Tune as old as song (oh oh)  
Bittersweet and strange  
Finding you can change  
Learning you were wrong  

Certain as the sun (certain as the sun)  
Rising in the east  
Tale as old as time (oh oh)  
Song as old as rhyme (oh oh)  
Flags of all the world  

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  

Tale as old as time (oh yeah)  
Tune as old as song (oh yeah)  
Bittersweet and strange  
Finding you can change  
Learning you were wrong  

Certain as the sun (certainly)   
Rising in the east   
Tale as old rhyming rhyme   
Song older than any rhyme   
Flags of all around world   

Ohhhhhhhhhh   
Flags of all around world!
