Here is my song about the flags of the world:

Verse 1:
C#m7   F#7   Bm
There's a boy named Jordan who loves to explore
C#m7   F#7   Bm
He travels around the world looking for more
C#m7   F#7   Bm
He likes to learn about different cultures and nations
C#m7   F#7   Bm
And he admires their colorful flags and their meanings

Chorus:
B     F#    G    Em
He sees white and blue in San Marino's flag
B     F#    G    Em
It represents peace and liberty that they have
B     F#    G    Em
He sees green and red in Macedonia's flag
B     F#    G    Em
It symbolizes their struggle and their courage

Verse 2:
C#m7   F#7   Bm
Jordan also has a passion for science and space
C#m7   F#7   Bm
He dreams of visiting the asteroid belt someday 
C#m7   F#7   Bm 
He wonders what secrets it holds in its rocks 
C#m7   F#7   Bm 
And how it formed from a planet that was lost 

Chorus:
B     F#    G    Em 
He sees black and green in Kuwait's flag 
B     F#    G    Em 
It stands for their prosperity and their land 
B     F#    G    Em 
He sees white and blue in San Marino's flag 
B     F#    G    Em 
It represents peace and liberty that they have 

Bridge:
Am      D      G      C  
But Jordan has a problem that he can't ignore 
Am      D      G      C  
He is cursed by an evil witch who wants him no more 
Am      D      G      C  
She cast a spell on him that makes him forget everything 
Am      D      G      C  
Every time he sees a flag, he loses a memory 

Verse 3: 
C#m7   F#7   Bm  
Jordan is losing his mind and his identity 
C#m7   F#7   Bm  
He can't remember who he is or where he wants to be 
C#m7   F #  1  B m   
 He needs to find a way to break this wicked curse   
 C # m  1  E # 1  E m   
 He needs to find someone who can help him reverse   

 Chorus:   
 E       E #       A       E m   
 He remembers Gregor Mendel, the father of genetics   
 E       E #       A       E m   
 He thinks maybe he can use his knowledge to fix it   
 E       E #       A       E m   
 He hopes to find a clue in Mendel's pea experiments   
 E       E #       A       E m   
 He hopes to find a cure for his memory loss ailment   

 Outro:   
 C # m 1 1 -E -E m -E -E m -E -E m -E -E m    
 Jordan, Jordan, don't give up on your quest    
 C # m 1 1 -E -E m -E -E m -E -E m -E -E m    
 You can still see all the flags of the world    
 C # m 1 1-E-E-m-E-E-m-E-E-m-E-E-m    
 You can still learn all their stories and their histories    
 C # M-11-F-11-B-M     
 You can still break free from this curse    

 The end!
