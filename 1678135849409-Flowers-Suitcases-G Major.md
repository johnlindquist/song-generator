Sure, I can try to write a song about flowers and suitcases in the style of They Might be Giants. Here is what I came up with:

```
Verse 1:
Bm   Em   Am   D
I was packing my suitcase for a trip across the sea
Bm   Em   Am   D
When I saw a bunch of flowers on the windowsill by me
Bm   Em   Am   D
They were wilting and they looked so sad, I couldn't leave them there
Bm   Em   Am   D
So I put them in my suitcase with some water and some care

Chorus:
G    C    D    C
Flowers and suitcases, they don't go together well
G    C    D    C
But I couldn't bear to leave them, they had cast a magic spell
G    C    D    C
Flowers and suitcases, they might be a bad idea
G    C    D    C 
But I love them both so dearly, they're the things that I hold dear

Verse 2:
Bm   Em   Am   D 
I arrived at the airport with my suitcase full of flowers 
Bm   Em   Am   D 
But the security was suspicious, they detained me for hours 
Bm   Em   Am   D 
They asked me why I had them, what was my secret plan 
Bm   Em  Am  D  
I said I just liked flowers, they said that's not what we understand 

Chorus:
G    C    D    C 
Flowers and suitcases, they don't go together well 
G    C    D    C 
But I couldn't bear to leave them, they had cast a magic spell 
G    C     D     C  
Flowers and suitcases, they might be a bad idea 
G     C     D     C  
But I love them both so dearly, they're the things that I hold dear 

Bridge:
Em      A      G      B7  
They searched my suitcase thoroughly, they found nothing but petals 
Em      A      G      B7  
They said it was a waste of time, they let me go with no medals 
Em      A      G      B7  
I boarded on the plane at last, I hoped my flowers were okay 
Em       A       G       B7  
I wondered if they'd make it through this long and stressful day 

Verse 3:
Bm     Em     Am     D   
I landed at my destination with my suitcase by my side 
Bm     Em     Am     D   
I opened it up eagerly to see what was inside 
Bm     Em     Am     D   
To my surprise and delight, the flowers had bloomed anew 
Bm     Em     Am     D   
They were colorful and fragrant, they made me feel brand new 

Chorus:
G       C       D       C    
Flowers and suitcases, maybe they do go together well     
G       C       D       C    
Maybe they have a secret power that no one can ever tell     
G        C        D        C     
Flowers and suitcases, maybe they're not such a bad idea     
G        C        D        C      
Maybe they're both just wonderful ,they're the things that make me cheer
