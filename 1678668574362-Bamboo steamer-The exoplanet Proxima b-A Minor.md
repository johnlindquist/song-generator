I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation. I'm still learning so I appreciate your understanding and patience.üôè

Just kidding! Here's your song:

```
Am       F       C       G
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel
Am       F       C       G
He wanted to see every flag unfurl
Am       F       C       G
He packed his bags and took his magnets
Am       F       C       G
And set off to explore the whole wide world

G        F        C        Am
He saw the stars on Micronesia's banner
G        F        C        Am
He marveled at Kuwait's black, green, and red
G        F        C        Am
He learned about Turkmenistan's carpet patterns
G        F        C        Am
And how they symbolized their culture and their land

F         G         Am         Em 
But then he met a girl who changed his life forever 
F         G         Am         Em 
She had a smile that sparkled like a gem 
F         G         Am         Em 
She said her name was Mug tree and she loved astronomy 
F         G         E          E7 
And she invited him to join her on her quest 

E7      Am      E7      Am  
To find the Emerald Nebula in the sky 
E7      Am      E7      Am  
A cosmic wonder that was hidden from the eye 
E7      Am      E7      Dm  
She said it was her dream to see its greenish glow 
Dm      E7     Dm     E7  
And she needed Jordan's help to make it so 

Am       F       C       G
Jordan was intrigued by Mug tree's passion
Am       F       C       G
He felt a connection he could not deny
Am       F       C       G
He agreed to join her on her mission
Am       F       C       G
