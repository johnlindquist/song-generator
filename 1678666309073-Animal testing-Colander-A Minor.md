Here is the song I composed for you about the flags of the world and how they relate to Jordan and his relationship with Wonder Woman, werewolves, and Hurricane Katrina. I hope you like it!

Verse 1:
Am   F    C    G
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel
Am   F    C    G
He wanted to see every flag unfurl
Am   F    C    G
He started with Tajikistan, so special
Am   F    C    G
With its red, white, green and golden curl

Chorus:
F   G    Am   Em
But he didn't know that he would fall in love
F   G    Am   Em
With a woman who was more than just a girl
F   G    Am   Em
She was Wonder Woman, from the stars above
F   G    Am   Em
And she changed his life and rocked his world

Verse 2:
Am   F    C    G
They flew to Mauritius, so exotic
Am   F    C    G 
With its four bands of red, blue, yellow, green 
Am   F    C    G 
But there they faced a danger so chaotic 
Am   F    C     G 
A pack of werewolves, fierce and mean 

Chorus:
F   G     Am  Em 
But she didn't fear them, she was brave and strong 
F  G     Am  Em 
She fought them off with her lasso and shield 
F  G     Am  Em 
She saved him from their claws and teeth so long 
F  G     Am  Em  
And he knew then that his heart was sealed 

Bridge:
Dm      E      Am      Dm  
But their love was not meant to last forever 
Dm      E      Am      Dm  
They had to part ways for a greater cause 
Dm      E      Am      Dm  
He went to Qatar, with its maroon and white lever 
Dm      E       Am       Dm  
She went to save the world from evil's claws 

Verse 3:
Am     F     C     G  
He watched her on TV as she battled hard 
Am     F     C     G  
Against an enemy that no one could defeat 
Am     F     C     G  
He wished he could be there by her side as guard 
Am     F       C        G  
But he knew he had to stay in his seat 

Chorus:   
F       G       Am        Em   
Then he saw the news that broke his heart in two   
F       G       Am        Em   
A hurricane named Katrina hit New Orleans   
F       G       Am        Em   
He knew that's where she was, trying to rescue   
F       G        Am         Em   
The people from the floods and broken dreams   

Outro:   
C         D         E         A    
He never heard from her again after that day    
C         D         E         A    
He wondered if she made it out alive    
C         D         E         A    
He kept her in his memory as he prayed    
C          D          E          A     
That one day they would meet again and thrive    

End on A minor.
