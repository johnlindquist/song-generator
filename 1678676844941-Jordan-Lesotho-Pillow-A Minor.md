I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation. Here is my real response:

Here is the song I composed for you. I hope you like it!

Am       F       C       G
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel
Am       F       C       G
He had a map and a pillow in his backpack
Am       F       C       G
He wanted to see every country in the world
Am       F       C       G
But he had a problem that he couldn't crack

C        G        Am      Em
He was allergic to health care
C        G        Am      Em
He sneezed whenever he saw a doctor or a nurse
C        G        Am      Em
He had to avoid all the hospitals and clinics
C        G        Am      Em 
Or he would end up feeling much worse

F        C        G        Am 
So he decided to visit some places 
F        C        G        Am 
Where health care was not very common or good 
F        C        G        Am 
He bought a ticket to Lesotho, Bahrain and Sao Tome and Principe 
F        C         E         E7  
And he hoped that he understood

Am       F       C       G  
What he was getting into (what he was getting into) 
Am       F       C       G  
What he was getting into (what he was getting into) 

Am      F     C     G  
Jordan arrived in Lesotho first 
Am      F     C     G  
He was amazed by the mountains and the culture 
Am      F     C     G  
He met some friendly people who invited him to their home 
Am      F     C     E7  
But then he saw something that made him shiver 

C         G         Am    Em   
They had a clock on their wall that looked familiar 
C         G         Am    Em   
It was the same one that his doctor had in his office 
C         G         Am    Em   
He felt a tickle in his nose and then he started to sneeze 
C         G         E    E7   
And he realized that it was no coincidence 

F          C          G          Am   
Someone had followed him from his hometown (someone had followed him) 
F          C          G          Am   
Someone had followed him from his hometown (someone had followed him) 
F          C          E           E7   
And they wanted to give him health care somehow 

Am      F     C     E7  
What were they getting into? (what were they getting into?) 
Am      F     E    E7  
What were they getting into? (what were they getting into?) 

(Repeat chorus)

(Repeat verse chords with instrumental solo)

(Bridge)
Dm           Dm/C            Dm/B            Dm/Bb    
Jordan ran away from Lesotho as fast as he could go 
Dm           Dm/C            Dm/B            Dm/Bb    
He hoped that Bahrain would be safer and more fun 
Dm           Dm/C            Dm/B            Dm/Bb    
But when he got there, he saw another clock on another wall 
Dm           Dm/C            Bb             A7     
And he knew that his troubles were not done 

(Repeat chorus)

(Repeat verse chords with instrumental solo)

(Bridge 2)
Dm           Dm/C            Dm/B            Dm/Bb    
Jordan decided to give up on his dream of seeing the world 
Dm           Dm/C            Dm/B            Dm/Bb    
He realized that health care was everywhere and unavoidable 
Dm           Dm/C            Bb             A7     
So he booked a flight to Sao Tome and Principe, his last stop 
Dm           Bb             A              A7     
And he hoped that there, at least, he could be lovable 

(Outro)
G              A              B              B7     
But when he landed, he saw something that made him smile (made him smile) 
G              A              B              B7     
There was no clock, no doctor, no nurse, no hospital (no hospital) 
G              A              B              B7     
There was only a girl with a pillow in her backpack (in her backpack)  
G               A               E               E7      
And she said "Hi, I'm Sydney. Do you want to travel?"  

(Fade out with chorus chords)
