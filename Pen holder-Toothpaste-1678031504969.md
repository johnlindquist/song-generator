Here is a song I wrote about Pen holder and Toothpaste in the style of They Might be Giants:

Verse 1: (D-A-G)
Pen holder was lonely on his desk
He had no friends to share his thoughts
He wished he had someone to hold his pens
And make him feel like he was not forgot

Chorus: (D-Bm-G-F#)
Then one day he saw her in the bathroom
She was so shiny and so smooth
She was Toothpaste, the queen of oral hygiene
And he knew he had to make his move

Verse 2: (D-A-G)
He waited for the right moment to approach her
He practiced what he wanted to say
He hoped she would not think he was a loser
And maybe she would like him anyway

Chorus: (D-Bm-G-F#)
But when he finally got the courage to speak to her
He found out she already had a mate
He was Toothbrush, the king of dental cleaning
And he did not like Pen holder's face

Bridge: (Bm-A-G-F#-Em-A-D)
Pen holder felt his heart break into pieces
He ran away from them as fast as he could
He did not know where he was going or what he was doing
He just wanted to get away from all the pain

Verse 3: (D-A-G)
He ended up in the kitchen by accident
He saw a Pie dish and a Whisk on the shelf
They looked at him with curiosity and kindness
They asked him if he needed any help

Chorus: (D-Bm-G-F#)
Pen holder told them everything that happened 
They listened with sympathy and care 
They said they knew how it felt to be rejected 
And they offered him a place to stay there 

Outro: (D-Bm-G-F#-D) 
Pen holder found new friends in Pie dish and Whisk 
They made him feel like he belonged 
They taught him how to bake delicious pies 
And they sang together happy songs 

The end.
