Here is the song I composed for you. I hope you like it. ðŸ˜Š

D             G              Bm             F#m
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel around the world
D             G              Bm             F#m
He had a passion for hand mixers, boxing and demons too
D             G              Bm             F#m
He wanted to see all the flags that flew in every land
D             G              Bm             F#m
But he didn't know what they meant or what they stood for

G            D               A               Em
So he bought a book that explained the history of flags
G            D               A               Em
And he learned about their colors, shapes and symbols
G            D               A               Em
He was amazed by how much they revealed about each nation
G            D               A               Em
And he sang this song to share his fascination

D           G                A                Bm 
Oh, the flags of the world are so beautiful and diverse 
D           G                A                Bm 
They tell us stories of culture, struggle and pride 
D           G                A                Bm 
Some have stars and stripes, some have crosses and crescents 
D           G                A                Bm 
Some have lions and eagles, some have suns and moons 

G            D               A               Em
Like Liechtenstein, whose flag has a crown on blue and red 
G            D               A               Em
It shows their monarchy and their independence 
G            D               A               Em
Or Afghanistan, whose flag has black, red and green 
G            D               A               Em
It represents their past, their blood and their hope 

D           G                A                Bm 
Oh, the flags of the world are so beautiful and diverse 
D           G                A                Bm 
They tell us stories of culture, struggle and pride 
D           G                A                Bm 
Some have triangles and squares, some have circles and stars 
D           G                A                Bm 
Some have dragons and flowers, some have swords and shields 

G            D               A               Em
Like Malta, whose flag has white and red with a cross on it 
G            D               A              Em  
It shows their faith
