Verse 1:
Em7     A7      Dmaj7
Jordan was a curious boy
Em7     A7      Dmaj7
He loved to explore the world
Em7     A7      Dmaj7
He packed his bags and bought a ticket
Em7     A7      Dmaj7
To see the islands of the Pacific

Chorus:
D       A       Bm      F#m

D       A       Bm      F#m 
And headed to the island of Malta 

Verse 3:
Em7     A7      Dmaj7 
Malta was a different story 
Em7     A7      Dmaj7  
It had a rich and ancient history  
Em7     A      Dmaj
