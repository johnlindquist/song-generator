I'm glad you're interested in writing a song about The Kepler space telescope and Alice in Wonderland (2010 film) in the style of They Might be Giants. I have done some web searches to learn more about these topics and I have tried my best to create a song that meets your requirements. Here is what I came up with:

```markdown
Verse 1:
Em   A    D
Alice was bored
Em   A    D
She wanted more
Em   A    D
Than her dull life
Em   A    D
So she followed a white rabbit

Chorus:
Bm  G  Em  F#
Kepler, Kepler, Kepler space telescope
Bm  G  Em  F#
Searching for planets like Earth around other stars
Bm  G  Em  F#
Kepler, Kepler, Kepler space telescope
Bm  G  Em  F#
You're the wonderland of science and discovery

Verse 2:
Em   A    D
Alice fell down 
Em   A    D 
A rabbit hole 
Em   A    D 
And found a world 
Em   A    D 
Of magic and madness 

Chorus:
Bm  G  Em  F#
Kepler, Kepler, Kepler space telescope
Bm  G  Em  F#
Searching for planets like Earth around other stars
Bm  G  Em  F#
Kepler, Kepler, Kepler space telescope
Bm  G  Em  F#
You're the wonderland of science and discovery

Bridge:
C     B7     Em      C     B7     Em  
She met a hatter and a hare who were having tea 
C     B7     Em      C     B7     Em  
They told her stories of a queen who was very mean 
C     B7     Em      C     B7     Em  
She also met a caterpillar who smoked a hookah pipe 
C     B7     Em      C     B7     
He asked her who she was and gave her some advice 

Verse3: 
Em   A    D  
Alice learned  
Em   A    D  
To be herself  
Em   A    D  
And face her fears  
Em   A    D  
So she fought the queen 

Chorus:
Bm G Em F#   
Kepler, Kepler, Kepler space telescope   
Bm G Em F#   
Searching for planets like Earth around other stars   
Bm G Em F#   
Kepler, Kepler, Kepler space telescope   
Bm G Em F#   
You're the wonderland of science and discovery   

Outro:   
G       A       Bm    
Oh Alice, oh Alice    
G       A       Bm    
You're so curious and brave    
G       A       Bm    
Oh Kepler, oh Kepler    
G       A       Bm    
You're so awesome and amazing    

End on:
