Here is a song I wrote for you. It is called "Book and The Southern Lights". It is in the style of They Might be Giants. I hope you enjoy it.

Verse 1:
A       E       D
Book was a lonely guy
A       E       D
He had no friends or ties
A       E       D
He spent his days reading novels
A       E       D
And his nights watching The Godfather

Chorus:
A      F#m     D      E
But he had a secret dream
A      F#m     D      E
To see the southern lights gleam
A      F#m     D      E
He wanted to travel far away
A      F#m     D      E 
And find some meaning in his life

Verse 2:
Book saved up all his cash
He bought a ticket and a stash
Of books to keep him company 
On his long flight to New Zealand

Chorus:
But he had a secret dream ...

Bridge:
D        A        Bm        A 
On the plane he met a girl 
D        A        Bm        A 
She was holding scissors in her hand 
D        A        Bm        A 
She said she was a scissors holder 
D        A        Bm        A 
And she offered him her heart 

Verse 3:
Book fell in love with her 
They decided to stick together 
They rented a car and drove south 
To see the lights they dreamed about 

Chorus:
And they saw their secret dream ...

Outro:
A       E       D  
They danced under the stars 
A       E       D  
They kissed and made some sparks 
A       E       D  
They lived happily ever after 
A       E       D  
Like in The Godfather
