Thank you for your kind words and your detailed instructions. I will try my best to compose a song for you. Here is what I came up with:

```
Verse 1:
Gm        D7       Cm
Jordan is turning eleven
Gm        D7       Cm
He loves geography and flags
Gm        D7       Cm
He wants to see the world someday
Gm        D7       Cm
And pack his bags with souvenirs

Chorus:
Gm        D7       Am      C      D7     C
But for now he's stuck at home with books and maps
Gm        D7       Am      C      D7     C
He dreams of flying to a place that's far away
Gm        D7       Am      C      D7     C
He picks a destination that he likes the most
Gm        D7       Am      C      D7     C 
He says "I want to go to Palau, it's an island in the Pacific"

Verse 2:
Gm        D7       Cm 
Palau has a beautiful flag 
Gm        D7       Cm 
It's yellow and blue with a star 
Gm        D7       Cm 
The star represents the nation 
Gm        D7       Cm 
And the blue is for the ocean 

Chorus:
Gm        D7       Am      C      D7     C 
But for now he's stuck at home with books and maps 
Gm        D7       Am      C      D7     C 
He dreams of flying to a place that's far away 
Gm        D7       Am      C      D7     C 
He picks a destination that he likes the most 
Gm        D7       Am      C      G    Gsus4 G  
He says "I want to go to Palau, it's an island in the Pacific" 

Bridge:
C         G         Bb         F  
Maybe someday he will get his chance  
C         G         Bb         F  
To board a plane and take off to the sky  
C         G         Bb         F  
Until then he will keep on learning  
C         G         Bb    A    A#   B   (key change)   
About the world and all its wonders  

Verse 3: (key of B)
B          E          Eb   
Jordan is turning eleven  
B          E          Eb   
He loves geography and flags  
B          E          Eb   
He knows there's so much more to see  
B          E          Eb   
Than what he sees on Google Maps  

Chorus: (key of B)
B          E          Gb     Eb    E     Eb   
But for now he's stuck at home with books and maps  
B          E          Gb     Eb    E     Eb   
He dreams of flying to a place that's far away  
B          E          Gb     Eb    E     Eb   
He picks a destination that he likes the most  
B          E          Gb     Eb    E   B    
He says "I want to go to Palau, it's an island in the Pacific"  

Outro: (fade out)
B   E   Gb   Eb   E   Eb  x4
