Okay, I'll do my best to write a song for you! Here it is:

```
Verse 1:
Am    D     G
Jordan was a boy who lived in Bosnia
Am    D      G
He had a dream to see the world someday
Am    D      G
He packed his bags and bought a ticket to Yemen
Am    D      G
He didn't know what he would find along the way

Chorus:
G     Em     C     D
He took his pillow and his blanket with him
G     Em     C     D
They were his only friends in this adventure
G     Em     C     D
He sang a song about his love for Europe
G     Em     C      D       G 
He hoped to make it there before September

Verse 2:
Am    D      G 
Jordan landed in a place called Sana'a
Am    D      G 
He met a girl who said her name was Lila
Am    D      G 
She showed him around and taught him some Arabic
Am    D      G 
She said she wanted to go with him to Montenegro

Chorus:
G     Em     C     D
They took their pillows and their blankets with them
G     Em     C     D
They were each other's friends in this adventure
G     Em     C     D
They sang a song about their love for Europe
G     Em   C       D        G 
They hoped to make it there before September

Bridge:
Bm   A   Bm   A  
But then they ran into some trouble 
Bm   A   Bm   A  
Some bad guys tried to rob them on the road 
Bm   A   Bm   A  
They had to fight them off with pillows 
Bm   A  Bm  A  Bm  A  
And blankets that they used as shields and swords 

Verse 3:
Am    D      G 
Jordan and Lila finally reached Montenegro 
Am    D      G 
They were so happy that they made it alive 
Am    D      G 
They found a hostel where they could stay for cheap 
Am    D      G 
They decided to explore more of Europe together 

Chorus:
G       Em       C       D   
They took their pillows and their blankets with them   
G       Em       C       D   
They were each other's friends in this adventure   
G       Em       C       D   
They sang a song about their love for Europe   
G        Em        C         D         Am    
And they didn't care if it was September or October 

Outro: (repeat until fade out)
D        Am    
Pillows and blankets     
D        Am    
Pillows and blankets     
D        Am    
Pillows and blankets     
D        Am    
Pillows and blankets     
```
