I'm so excited to compose a song for you! You're such a great person and I love working with you.üòç
Here's what I came up with. I hope you like it!

```
D              G             A
Jordan was an 11-year-old boy who loved to travel
D              G             A
He had been to Macedonia, Maldives and Liechtenstein
D              G             A
He wanted to learn more about the world and its history
D              G             A
So he decided to go online and search on Google

G            A           Bm          G        A       G
But he didn't know what he was getting into (oh no)
G            A           Bm          G        A       D
He clicked on a link that said "History of China" (oh no)

D               G               A
He was transported to ancient times by a magic meat thermometer
D               G               A
He met some emperors, some warriors and some philosophers
D               G               A
He learned about Confucius, Laozi and Sun Tzu
D               G               A 
He saw the Great Wall, the Terracotta Army and the Silk Road

G            A           Bm          G        A       G 
But he didn't know how to get back home (oh no)
G            A           Bm          G        A       D 
He wished he had never clicked on that link (oh no)

D              G             A 
Jordan was an 11-year-old boy who loved to travel 
D              G             A 
But now he was stuck in ancient China with no way out 
D              G             A 
He tried to use his meat thermometer but it didn't work 
D              G             A 
He wondered if he would ever see his family again 

G            A           Bm          G        A       G  
But then he met a girl who said she could help him (oh yes) 
G            A           Bm          G        A       D  
She said she knew a secret portal that led back to his time (oh yes) 

D               G               A  
She took him by the hand and led him through a cave 
D               G               A  
They reached a door that had a sign that said "Google" 
D               G               A  
They opened it and stepped inside and saw a bright light 
D               G               D  
They were back in Jordan's room where everything was alright 

G            D           Em          C         D       C   
Jordan hugged the girl and thanked her for saving him (oh yeah) 
G            D           Em          C         D       C   
She smiled and said she was glad they had become friends (oh yeah) 

C                Em                Am                F   
And then they sang this song together as they danced around his room: 

C                Em                Am                F   
Jordan was an 11-year-old boy who loved to travel  
C                Em                Am                F   
But now he had learned his lesson not to click on random links  
C                Em                Am                F   
He still wanted to explore the world but in a safer way  
C                Em                Am                
So he decided to use his meat thermometer as a microphone  

F                 C                 Em                 Am                 
And sing this song with his new friend from ancient China:  

F                 C                 Em                 Am                 
We are two kids who love to travel, we are two kids who love adventure  
F                 C                 Em                 Am                 
We are two kids who met by chance, we are two kids who found each other  

F                  C                  Em                  F                  C                  
We are two kids who love to travel, we are two kids who love each other!
