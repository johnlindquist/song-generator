Thank you for your kind words and encouragement. I will try my best to compose a song for you. Here is what I came up with:

```markdown
C              F              G
Jordan is a boy who loves geography
C              F              G
He knows all the flags of every country
C              F              G
But he has a dream that he wants to fulfill
C              F              G
He wants to travel to São Tomé and Príncipe

C       Am      Em      F
So he saves up all his money 
C       Am      Em      F
And he buys a plane ticket 
C       Am      Em      F
On his eleventh birthday 
C       Am      Em      F
He's ready for his trip 

G             C             G             C  
He flies across the ocean, he sees the island green 
G             C             G             C  
He lands in the capital, he feels like a king 
G             C             G             C  
He sees the flag waving, red yellow and green 
G             C             G             C  
With two black stars and a triangle in between 

C              F              G
Jordan is amazed by all the sights and sounds 
C              F              G
He learns about the history and culture of the town 
C              F              G
He makes some friends along the way who show him around 
C              F              G
He even learns some Portuguese words that he can pronounce 

C       Am      Em      F
But he knows he can't stay forever 
C       Am      Em      F
He has to go back home someday 
C       Am      Em      F
So he takes a lot of pictures 
C       Am      Em      F
And he buys some souvenirs 

G             C             G             C  
He flies back to his country, he shows his family what he's seen 
G             C             G             C  
He tells them all his stories, he shares his memories 
G             C             G             C  
He keeps the flag in his room, red yellow and green 
G             C            (F)            (G)           (F)          (G)         (F)        (G)
With two black stars and a triangle in between 

(F)        (G)         (F)        (G)
Jordan is a boy who loves geography 
(F)        (G)         (F)        (G)
And now he has fulfilled his dream
