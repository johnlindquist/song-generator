Thank you for your kind words. I appreciate your confidence in me. Here is the song I composed for you:

```
Dm       A7      Dm
Jordan is turning eleven
Dm       A7      Dm
He loves geography and heaven
Dm       A7      Dm
He knows all the flags of the world
Dm       A7      Dm
He likes to draw them when he's bored

Gm       A7      Dm
But he has a secret dream
Gm       A7      Dm
He wants to go to Mars one day
Gm       A7      Dm
He thinks it would be so cool
Gm       A7      Dm
To explore the red planet's pool

Em       A7      Em (chorus)
Jordan, Jordan, don't give up your hope 
Em       A7      Em 
Jordan, Jordan, you have a telescope 
Em       A7      Em 
Jordan, Jordan, you can see the stars 
Em       B7      Em 
Jordan, Jordan, maybe one day you'll go to Mars 

Dm       C        Am        G (bridge)
But he also cares about the Earth 
Dm       C        Am        G 
He doesn't like animal testing 
Dm       C        Am        G 
He thinks it's cruel and unfair 
Dm       C        Am        G 
He wants to protect all the bears 

Dm       A7      Dm (verse)
One day he learned about Brunei 
Dm       A7      Dm  
A small country in Southeast Asia 
Dm       A7      Dm  
He was fascinated by its flag 
Dm       A7      DmA  
It had yellow, black, white and red 

Gm       A7
