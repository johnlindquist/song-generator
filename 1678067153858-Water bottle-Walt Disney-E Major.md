# Water Bottle and Walt Disney

Verse 1:
F#m B E
Water bottle was a lonely guy
F#m B E
He had no friends, he didn't know why
F#m B E
He wished he could be someone else
F#m B E
Someone who was cool and had some wealth

Chorus:
E B C#m A
Then one day he saw a poster on the wall
E B C#m A
It said "Come to Disneyland, have a ball"
E B C#m A
He packed his bags and took a plane
E B C#m A
He hoped his life would never be the same

Verse 2:
F#m B E
When he arrived he was amazed
F#m B E
He saw Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck on parade
F#m B E 
He felt a spark of joy inside his heart 
F#m B E 
He wanted to be part of this magical art 

Chorus:
E B C#m A 
Then he saw him, the man behind it all 
E B C#m A 
Walt Disney, standing tall and proud 
E B C#m A 
He ran up to him and said "Hello" 
E B C#m A 
He hoped that Walt would be his hero 

Bridge:
G D F G 
But Walt looked at him with disdain 
G D F G  
He said "You're just a plastic thing, you have no brain" 
G D F G  
He threw him in the trash with a sneer 
G D F G  
He said "You don't belong here"

Verse 3:
F#m B E  
Water bottle felt a surge of pain 
F#m B E  
He realized that Walt was not so great 
F#m B E  
He crawled out of the garbage can 
F#m B E  
He decided to make his own plan 

Chorus:   
E B C#m A   
He met some other outcasts like him   
E B C#m A   
A garlic press, a broken toy, a rusty pin   
E B C#m A   
They formed a band and sang their songs   
E B C#m A   
They said "We don't need Walt, we are strong"

Outro:    
C D Em G    
They might be giants (Yeah)    
C D Em G    
They might be giants (Yeah)    
C D Em G    
They might be water bottles or garlic presses or pins     
C D Em G     
But they are happy in their own skins
