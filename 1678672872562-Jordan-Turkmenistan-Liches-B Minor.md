# The Adventures of Jordan and Sasquatch

Verse 1:
Bm     D    G    A    D    G
Jordan was an average boy from Turkmenistan
Bm     D    G    A    D    G
He loved to watch The Dark Knight and play with his Batman
Bm     D    G    A    D    G
But one day he found a map that led him to Kyrgyzstan
Bm     D    G    A   Bm
Where he met a hairy beast that changed his life plan

Chorus:
Em   A   Bm
Sasquatch, Sasquatch, he's Jordan's best friend
Em   A   Bm
Sasquatch, Sasquatch, they have adventures without end
Em   A   Bm
Sasquatch, Sasquatch, he's not a myth or a legend
Em   A  Bm 
Sasquatch, Sasquatch, he's just a really big man

Verse 2:
Bm     D    G    A    D    G
Jordan and Sasquatch traveled across the land
Bm     D    G    A    D    G
They saw many sights and wonders that were grand
Bm     D    G      A      D       G 
But they also faced some dangers that they had to withstand 
Bm     D      G       A        Bm 
Like liches and dragons and an evil wizard's band

Chorus:
Em   A   Bm
Sasquatch, Sasquatch, he's Jordan's best friend
Em   A   Bm
Sasquatch, Sasquatch, they have adventures without end
Em   A   Bm 
Sasquatch, Sasquatch, he's not a myth or a legend 
Em   A  Bm 
Sasquatch, Sasquatch, he's just a really big man

Bridge:
F#7        Em7         F#7        Em7  
But their journey was not over yet 
F#7        Em7         F#7        Em7  
They had one more place to go 
F#7        Em7         F#7        Em7  
A country full of mystery and history 
F#7        Em7         F#7        Em7  
The land of Georgia 

Verse 3:
Bm     D      G       A       D      G  
There they found the secret of Sasquatch's origin 
Bm     D      G       A       D      G  
He was once a human prince who was cursed by a djinn 
Bm     D      G       A       D      G  
Only true love's kiss could break the spell he was in 
Bm     D      G       A          Bm   
And Jordan knew just what to do to make him grin 

Chorus:
Em   A   Bm   
Sasquatch, Sasquatch, he's Jordan's best friend 
Em   A   Bm   
Sasquatch, Sasquatch, they have adventures without end 
Em   A          Bm    
Sasquatch, Sas-qu-aa-tch! (Jordan kisses him on the cheek)   
D           C          Bb          Am    
He turns back into a human again! 

Outro:   
G           F           Eb          C    
He turns back into a human again!   
G           F           Eb          C    
He turns back into a human again!   
G           F           Eb          C    
He turns back into a human again!   
G           F           Eb          C    
He turns back into...a human...again!
