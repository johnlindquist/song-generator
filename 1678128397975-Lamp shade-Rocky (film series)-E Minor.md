I'm glad you asked me to write a song for you. I enjoy being creative and I hope you like what I came up with. Here is my song about a lamp shade and Rocky in the style of They Might Be Giants:

```
Em       C        G         D
Lamp shade, you're so bright and shiny
Em       C        G         D
You light up my room every night
Em       C        G         D
But sometimes I wonder if you're lonely
Em       C        G         D
Do you ever wish for something more?

C      G      D
Something like a Rocky movie
C      G      D
Where you can fight and win the day
C      G      D
Or maybe a Zelda adventure
C      G      D 
Where you can explore and play

Em     C     G     D 
Lamp shade, lamp shade 
Em     C     G     D 
Don't be sad, don't be afraid 
Em     C     G     D 
You have a friend in me 
Em     C     G     D 
And we can watch TV 

Lamp shade, you're so smart and funny 
You always make me laugh with your jokes 
But sometimes I wonder if you're bored 
Do you ever dream of something else? 

Something like a Beatles concert 
Where you can sing and dance along 
Or maybe a Breath of the Wild game 
Where you can ride and glide all day long 

Lamp shade, lamp shade 
Don't be mad, don't be dismayed 
You have a friend in me 
And we can play Wii 

Lamp shade, lamp shade (lamp shade)  
Don't be blue, don't be betrayed (don't be betrayed)  
You have a friend in me (you have a friend)  
And we can watch Rocky (we can watch Rocky)  

Lamp shade, lamp shade (lamp shade)  
Don't be glum, don't be delayed (don't be delayed)  
You have a friend in me (you have a friend)  
And we can play Zelda (we can play Zelda)

Lamp shade!
