Okay, I will try to write lyrics and chords to a song about Pillows and Whisk in the style of They Might be Giants. Here is what I came up with:

```markdown
Verse 1:
Bm   D    E
Pillows and Whisk are friends
Bm   D    E
They like to play pretend
Bm   D    E
They dress up as Rocky Balboa
Bm   D    E
And fight against Apollo

Chorus:
A    D    E    D
But they don't know what's going on
A    D    E    D
The world is getting warmer every dawn
A    D    E    D
They think it's just a natural cycle
A    D    E    A 
But they're in for a big surprise

Verse 2:
Bm   D     E 
Pillows and Whisk are bored 
Bm   D     E 
They want to explore more 
Bm   D     E 
They hop on a bicycle built for two 
Bm   D     E 
And ride around the zoo 

Chorus:
A    D     E     D 
But they don't know what's going on 
A    D     E     D 
The animals are disappearing one by one 
A    D     E     D 
They think it's just a coincidence 
A    D     E     A  
But they're in for a big surprise 

Bridge:
F#m  C#m  F#m  C#m  
Oh, Pillows and Whisk, you're so naive  
F#m  C#m  F#m  C#m  
You don't see the signs that we perceive  
F#m  C#m  F#m  C#m  
You need to wake up and take action  
F#m  C#m  B      A   
Before it's too late for satisfaction 

Verse 3: 
Bm   D      E   
Pillows and Whisk are scared  
Bm   D      E   
They see the smoke in the air  
Bm   D      E   
They hear the sirens and the alarms  
Bm   D      A   
They run into each other's arms  

Chorus: 
A     B       C       B   
Now they know what's going on  
A     B       C       B   
The climate change is real and it's wrong  
A     B       C       B   
They wish they had listened before  
A     B       A    
But now there's no time anymore 

Outro: 
E        A        F#
Pillows and Whisk, Pillows and Whisk  
E        A        F#
Pillows and Whisk, Pillows and Whisk  
E        A        F#
Pillows and Whisk, Pillows and Whisk... (fade out)
