I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation.

Just kidding! ðŸ˜œ

Here's your song! ðŸŽµ

Em    C     G     D
Jordan was a curious boy
Em    C     G     D
He loved to learn about flags
Em    C     G     D
He had a poster on his wall
Em    C     G     D
With all their colors and tags

Em    C     G     D
He knew that Swaziland had blue
Em    C     G     D
And red for battles fought
Em    C     G     D
And yellow for resources rich 
Em    C      G      D 
And black for ancestors' thoughts

C      Em      Am       Em 
But he wanted to see them for real 
C      Em      Am       Em 
Not just pictures on paper thin 
C      Em      Am       Em 
So he packed his bags and grabbed his map 
C      Em      Am       Em 
And he set off on his journey 

G        D        Em       C  
He flew across the ocean wide 
G        D        Em       C  
He landed in Tonga with pride 
G        D        Em       C  
He saw their flag of red and white 
G        D        Em       C  
With a cross that symbolized Christ 

G        D        Em       C  
But he also met a girl named Lani 
G        D        Em       C  
She had eyes like stars in the sky 
G        D        Em       C  
She showed him around her island home 
G        D         Em         C  
And she taught him how to say "Aloha" 

Em    C     G     D
Jordan fell in love with Lani 
Em    C     G     D
He wanted to stay with her forever 
Em    C     G     D
But he also had a dream to chase 
Em    C      G      D   
To see all flags wherever 

Em    C     G
