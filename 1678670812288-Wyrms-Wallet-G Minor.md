Okay, I'll do my best to compose a song for you. Here it is:

# Flags of the World

Verse 1:
Gm    Eb    F    Dm
Jordan was a curious boy
Gm    Eb    F    Dm
He loved to learn about the world
Gm    Eb    F    Dm
He had a passion for potions
Gm    Eb    F    Dm
And a crush on a girl named Lipstick

Chorus:
Gm    D7   Am   Bb
But he also loved the flags of the world
Gm    D7   Am   Bb
He admired their colors, shapes, and symbols
Gm    D7   Am   Bb
He dreamed of traveling to every nation
Gm    D7   Am   Bb 
And collecting their flags as his mission

Verse 2:
Gm     Eb     F     Dm 
One day he saw a flag that caught his eye
Gm     Eb     F     Dm 
It was green, red, black, and yellow with a tusk and leaves (Vanuatu)
Gm     Eb     F     Dm 
He wondered what it meant and where it came from
Gm     Eb     F     Dm 
So he decided to find out more about it

Chorus:
(Repeat)

Verse 3:
Gm      Eb      F      Dm 
He learned that Vanuatu was an island nation
Gm      Eb      F      Dm 
With a rich culture and history of independence (Vanuatu)
Gm      Eb      F      Dm 
He was fascinated by their stories and traditions
Gm      Eb      F      Dm 
And he wanted to visit them someday

Bridge:
C       G       Am       Em  
But Lipstick didn't share his enthusiasm (Lipstick)
C       G       Am       Em  
She thought he was wasting his time on trivial things (Lipstick)
C       G       Am       Em  
She wanted him to focus on their chemistry (Lipstick)
C       G       Am       Em  
And not on some flags that didn't mean anything

Verse 4:
Gm        Eb        F        Dn 
Jordan felt hurt by her words and attitude (Jordan)
Gn        Eb        F        Dh 
He thought she would support his interests and dreams (Jordan)
Dn        C         Bb        A   
He realized they were not compatible at all (Jordan)
Dn        C         Bb        A   
And he decided to break up with her once and for all (Jordan)

Chorus:
(Repeat)

Verse 5:
Dn         C          Bb         A   
Now Jordan was free to pursue his passion (Jordan)
Dn         C          Bb         A   
He packed his bags and bought a plane ticket (Jordan)
Dn         C          Bb         A   
He flew to Georgia, Moldova, and other countries (Georgia) (Moldova)  
Dn         C          Bb         A   
And he collected their flags along the way

Outro:
F           C           G           Am  
He met new people, learned new things, had new experiences (Jordan)  
F           C           G           Am  
He felt happy, fulfilled, and adventurous (Jordan)  
F           C           G           Am  
He also met Gregor Mendel, the father of genetics (Gregor Mendel)  
F           C           G           Am  
And they became best friends forever 

End on: G Minor chord.
