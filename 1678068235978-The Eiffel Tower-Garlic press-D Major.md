The Eiffel Tower and The Garlic Press
A song by They Might Be Giants

Verse 1:
Em   A7   Dm   G7
I was in Paris with my garlic press
Em   A7   Dm   G7
Looking for a place to cook and rest
Em   A7   Dm   G7
When I saw her standing there so tall and fair
Em   A7   Dm   
The Eiffel Tower with her metal hair

Chorus:
D    Bm    G    A
She might be a tower (girl)
D    Bm    G    A
She might be a tower 
D    Bm    G    A
She might be steel, she might be iron 
D    Bm    G    
She might be something else that rhymes with iron

Verse 2:
Em   A7   Dm   G7
I approached her with my garlic press 
Em   A7   Dm   G7
And asked her if she wanted to impress 
Em   A7   Dm   G7
Some tourists with a culinary show 
Em   A7   Dm   
She said yes and then she told me where to go 

Chorus:
D    Bm    G    A
She might be a tower (girl)
D    Bm    G    A
She might be a tower 
D    Bm    G    A
She might be French, she might be chic 
D    Bm    G    
She might be something else that rhymes with chic 

Bridge:
C     F     C     F  
We went to her kitchen at the top 
C     F     C     F  
And started to chop some garlic cloves 
C     F     C     F  
But then we heard a knock on the door 
C     F     
It was Barack Obama with some magnets galore 

Verse 3:
Em      A7      Dm      G7
He said he came to campaign for his second term 
Em      A7      Dm      G7
And he needed some garlic for his speech to affirm 
Em      A7      Dm      G7
He also brought some magnets for the tower's attraction 
Em      A7      Dm      
But she said no thanks, she had enough satisfaction 

Chorus:
D       Bm       G       A  
She might be a tower (girl) 
D       Bm       G       A  
She might be a tower  
D       Bm       G       A  
She might be strong, she might be brave  
D       Bm       G       
She might be something else that rhymes with brave 

Outro:
Em        A7        Dm        G   
So we said goodbye to Obama and his magnets too 
Em        A7        Dm        G   
And we continued our cooking just us two 
Em        A7        Dm        G   
And as we ate our garlic bread under the stars 
Em        A7        D   
We realized we were happy just the way we are 

End on Em.
