Thank you for your kind words and encouragement. I will try my best to compose a song for you. Here is what I came up with:

```markdown
E C#m A G#
Jordan is a boy who loves geography
E C#m A G#
He knows all the flags of every country
E C#m A G#
He likes to draw them on his bedroom wall
E C#m A G#
But his favorite one is Swaziland

F#m B E
Swaziland, Swaziland
F#m B E
The land of the Swazi people and the king
F#m B E
It has a shield and spears on its flag
F#m B E
And Jordan thinks that's really rad

E C#m A G#
Jordan wants to go to Swaziland someday
E C#m A G#
He dreams of seeing lions and elephants play
E C#m A G#
He wants to learn about their culture and history
E C#m A G#
And maybe even solve a mystery

F#m B E 
Swaziland, Swaziland 
F#m B E 
The land of the Swazi people and the king 
F#m B E 
It has a shield and spears on its flag 
F#m B E 
And Jordan thinks that's really rad 

E C#m A G#
On his eleventh birthday, he got a surprise 
E C#m A G#
His parents bought him tickets for a flight 
E C#m A G#
They said they're going to Swaziland for a week 
E C#m A G#
And Jordan was so happy he could barely speak 

F#m B E 
Swaziland, Swaziland 
F#m B E 
The land of the Swazi people and the king 
F#m B E 
It has a shield and spears on its flag 
F#m B E 
And Jordan thinks that's really rad 

E C#m A G#
When they arrived in Swaziland, they rented a car 
E C#m A G#
They drove around the country near and far 
E C #mA G #
They visited the capital city Mbabane  
E
