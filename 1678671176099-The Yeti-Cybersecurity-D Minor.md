Here is the song I composed for you about the flags of the world. I hope you like it! ðŸ˜Š

Verse 1:
Dm G C
There's a boy named Jordan who loves to travel
Dm G C
He wants to see every flag that he can unravel
Dm G C
He likes the colors, shapes, and symbols on each one
Dm G C
He thinks they tell a story of where they come from

Chorus:
F C Dm Bb
But he can't go anywhere 'cause there's a pandemic
F C Dm Bb
He's stuck at home with his jogging pants and Netflix
F C Dm Bb
He dreams of flying to Comoros, Azerbaijan, and Macedonia
F C Dm Bb 
But he can't even see the moon 'cause it's The Moonless Earth

Verse 2:
Dm G C 
So he spends his time online looking at pictures of flags
Dm G C 
He learns about their history and culture and facts
Dm G C 
He likes the green star on Comoros that represents Islam
Dm G C 
He likes the eight-pointed star on Azerbaijan that stands for Turkic heritage

Chorus:
F C Dm Bb 
But he can't go anywhere 'cause there's a pandemic
F C Dm Bb 
He's stuck at home with his jogging pants and Netflix
F C Dm Bb 
He dreams of flying to Comoros, Azerbaijan, and Macedonia
F C Dm Bb 
But he can't even see the moon 'cause it's The Moonless Earth

Bridge:
Bb F A Dm 
One day he gets a message from a girl named Luna
Bb F A Dm 
She says she lives in Macedonia and she loves flags too
Bb F A Dm 
She sends him a picture of her holding the flag with red and yellow sun rays (Macedonia)
Bb F A Dm 
She says she wants to meet him someday when things get better

Verse 3:
Dm G C 
Jordan feels a spark in his heart when he sees her smile (Luna)
Dm G C 
He thinks she's beautiful and smart and has a lot of style (Luna)
Dm G C 
He tells her he wants to see her flag in person someday (Macedonia)
Dm G C  
He tells her he wants to hold her hand under the moonlight (Luna)

Chorus:
F C Dm Bb  
But they can't go anywhere 'cause there's a pandemic (Jordan & Luna)
F C Dm Bb  
They're stuck at home with their jogging pants and Netflix (Jordan & Luna)
F C Dm Bb  
They dream of flying to Comoros, Azerbaijan, and Macedonia (Jordan & Luna)
F C Dm Bb  
But they can't even see the moon 'cause it's The Moonless Earth (Jordan & Luna)

Outro:
Bb F A Dm  
But they don't give up hope 'cause they have each other (Jordan & Luna)
Bb F A Dm  
They keep talking online every day and night (Jordan & Luna)
Bb F A D M  
They know that someday they'll see all the flags of the world together (Jordan & Luna)   
Bb F A DM   
And they'll kiss under the moon when it comes back to life (Jordan & Luna) 

The End!
