Okay, I will try to write lyrics and chords to a song about a can opener and glasses in the style of They Might be Giants. Here is what I came up with:

```markdown
Verse 1: (I-IV-v-iii)
C F am em
He was a lonely can opener in the kitchen drawer
C F am em
She was a pair of glasses on the bathroom floor
C F am em
They never met each other but they shared a common dream
C F am em
To see the world beyond their walls and find out what it means

Chorus: (V-IV-I)
G F C
They might be lovers (boy) they might be lovers
G F C
They might be cans they might be eyes 
G F C 
They might be opening up their hearts to each other's lives 
G F C 
They might be lovers (boy) they might be lovers

Verse 2: (I-IV-v-iii)
C F am em 
One day he got a chance to escape from his drawer 
C F am em 
He rolled across the kitchen floor and out the open door 
C F am em 
He saw the sun and felt the breeze and thought he was free 
C F am em 
But then he saw her lying there and knew she was the one for me 

(Repeat chorus)

Bridge: (vi-V-IV-I)
am G F C 
But how could they ever be together when they're so different? 
am G F C 
He's made of metal she's made of glass he's sharp she's fragile 
am G F C  
But maybe that's what makes them perfect for each other after all 

Verse 3: (I-IV-v-iii)
C F am em  
He picked her up with his handle and held her close to his face 
C F am em  
She felt his warmth and saw his smile and gave him a gentle embrace 
C F am em  
They decided to run away and find a place where they belong 
C F am em  
And as they left they sang this song 

(Repeat chorus twice)

Outro: (I-V-vi-IV)
C G am F  
They might be lovers (boy) they might be lovers x4
