# Flags Of The World

Verse 1:
F#m7    B7      Emaj7
I wonder what they mean
F#m7    B7      Emaj7
Those colors on your screen
F#m7    B7      Emaj7
They're flying in the breeze
F#m7    B7      Emaj7
They're symbols of your dreams

Chorus:
E       C#m     G#m     A
Flags of the world, you're so beautiful
E       C#m     G#m     A
Flags of the world, you're so wonderful
E       C#m     G#m     A
Flags of the world, you're so magical
E       C#m     G#m     A 
Flags of the world, you make me feel alive

Verse 2:
F#m7    B7      Emaj7 
I love your different shapes 
F#m7    B7      Emaj7 
Some are squares and some are tapes 
F#m7    B7      Emaj7 
I love your different hues 
F#m7    B7      Emaj7 
Some are red and some are blues 

(Chorus)

Bridge:
Cmaj9   Dmaj9   Fmaj9   Gmaj9  
But sometimes you cause trouble 
Cmaj9   Dmaj9   Fmaj9   Gmaj9  
Sometimes you make me cry 
Cmaj9   Dmaj9   Fmaj9   Gmaj9  
Sometimes you start a war 
Cmaj9   Dmaj9   Fmaj9   Gmaj9  
Sometimes you make me wonder why 

Verse 3:
F#m7    B7      Emaj7 
But I can't help but admire 
F#m7    B7      Emaj7 
The stories you inspire 
F#m7    B7      Emaj6/11 (Montenegro)   
The eagle and the lion (Samoa)   
The stars and stripes (São Tomé and Príncipe)   

(Chorus)

Outro:
E       C#m     G#m     A  
Flags of the world, I want to know you more 
E       C#m     G#m     A  
Flags of the world, I want to explore your shores 
E       C#m     G#m     A  
Flags of the world, I want to sing your songs
