Am       F      Dm      E
Hat was a lonely milliner
Am       F      Dm      E
He made hats for everyone in town
Am       F      Dm      E
But he never had a customer
Am       F      Dm      E
Who would wear his hat with a frown

C        G       F
Then one day he met a wyrm
C        G       F
A dragon with a fiery breath
C        G       F
He asked him if he wanted a hat
C        G       F     E 
The wyrm said yes and smiled to death

Am       C     G    F   E 
Hat and wyrm, they became friends 
Am       C     G    F   E 
They went on many wild adventures 
Am       C     G    F   E 
They faced centaurs and divination 
Am       C     G    F   E 
They had fun with no hesitation 

Am       F      Dm      E
Hat made hats for all the wyrms 
Am       F      Dm      E
He even made one for the king 
Am       F      Dm      E
But he never forgot his first friend 
Am       F      Dm      E
Who gave him joy and everything 

C        G       F  
Now they live in harmony  
C        G       F  
Hat and wyrm, they're family  
C        G       F  
They share their hats and stories  
C        G       F     E   
They're happy as can be  

Am       C     G    F   E 
Hat and wyrm, they became friends 
Am       C     G    F   E 
They went on many wild adventures 
Am       C     G    F   E 
They faced centaurs and divination 
Am       C     G    F   E  Am  (end on Am)
They had fun with no hesitation
