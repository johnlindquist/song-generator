Okay, I'll try my best to write a song about the flags of the world. Here's what I came up with:

```markdown
Verse 1:
Gm   Dm   Eb   F
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel
Gm   Dm   Eb   F
He wanted to see every flag unfurl
Gm   Dm   Eb   F
He packed his bags and his keyboard cleaner
Gm   Dm   Eb   F
And set off to explore the whole wide world

Chorus:
Cm  G7  Cm  G7
He saw the flag of Monaco so red and white
Cm  G7  Cm  G7
He saw the flag of Georgia with its crosses bright
Cm  G7  Cm  G7
He saw the flag of Kiribati with its rising sun
Cm  G7  Cm  
And he sang a song about the flags of the world

Verse 2:
Gm   Dm   Eb   F
Jordan met a girl who loved to watch movies
Gm   Dm   Eb   F
She invited him to join her for a night 
Gm   Dm   Eb    F 
They watched Jaws and he got so scared 
Gm    D    E     F 
He spilled his keyboard cleaner on her dress

Chorus:
Cm  G7  Cm  G7  
She saw the flag of Monaco so red and white 
C    G    C    G   
She saw the flag of Georgia with its crosses bright 
C    G    C    G   
She saw the flag of Kiribati with its rising sun 
C    G    C    
And she sang a song about the flags of the world 

Bridge: 
Am     Em     Am     Em     
But then they had a fight about their favorite trolls 
Am     Em     Am     Em     
She liked Poppy and he liked Branch 
Am     Em     Am     Em     
They couldn't agree on anything at all 
Am     Em     Am     
So they decided to part ways 

Verse 3: 
G      D      E      F      
Jordan was sad and he missed her so much 
G      D      E      F      
He realized he loved her more than flags 
G      D      E      F      
He bought a ticket and flew back to her town 
G      D      E      F      
And hoped she would take him back 

Chorus: 
C       G       C       G       
He showed her the flag of Monaco so red and white  
C       G       C       G       
He showed her the flag of Georgia with its crosses bright  
C       G       C       G       
He showed her the flag of Kiribati with its rising sun  
C       G       C       
And he sang a song about his love for her  

Outro:  
F        C        F        C        
She forgave him and they hugged and kissed  
F        C        F        C        
They watched Jaws again and laughed at it  
F        C        F        C        
They agreed to disagree on their favorite trolls  
F        C        F         
And they lived happily ever after  

The End.
