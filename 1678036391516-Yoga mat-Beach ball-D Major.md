Here is a song I wrote about a Yoga mat and Beach ball in the style of They Might be Giants. I hope you enjoy it!

D         G        Bm       A
Yoga mat was feeling kind of flat
D         G        Bm       A
She had no friends to talk or chat
D         G        Bm       A
She wished she could go out and play
D         G        Bm       A
But she was stuck inside all day

G         A        Bm       F#
Then one day she saw a sight
G         A        Bm       F#
A shiny ball that bounced in light
G         A        Bm       F#
She felt a spark inside her heart
G         A        Bm       F#
She wanted to be friends with Beach ball

    G      A      Bm     F#
Oh Beach ball, you're so fun and round
    G      A      Bm     F#
You make me want to leave the ground
    G      A      Bm     F#
Oh Beach ball, you're so bright and cool
    G      A      Bm     F#
You make me want to break the rules

D         G        Bm       A
Yoga mat rolled herself outside 
D         G        Bm       A 
She found Beach ball by the tide 
D         G        Bm       A 
She said hello and asked his name 
D         G        Bm       A 
He said he liked her just the same 

G         A        Bm       F# 
They started to play on the sand 
G         A        Bm       F# 
They laughed and bounced and held hands 
G         A        Bm       F# 
They felt so happy and so free 
G         A        Bm       F# 
They felt like they were meant to be 

    G      A      Bm     F#
Oh Beach ball, you're so fun and round 
    G      A      Bm     F# 
You make me want to leave the ground 
    G      A      Bm     F# 
Oh Beach ball, you're so bright and cool 
    G      A      BM     F#  
You make me want to break the rules 

D          Em7   Asus4  D/F#  
But then came Toothbrush with his frown  
D          Em7   Asus4  D/F#  
He said they had to settle down  
D          Em7   Asus4  D/F#  
He said that they were being bad  
D          Em7   Asus4  D/F#  
He said that they should go back  

Em7           Asus4   D/F#   Cadd9   
He said that Yoga mat was too thin   
Em7           Asus4   D/F#   Cadd9   
He said that Beach ball was too big   
Em7           Asus4   D/F#   Cadd9   
He said that they were not a match   
Em7           Asus4   D/F#   Cadd9   
He said that they should break up  

    Em7    Asus4  D/F#  Cadd9    
Oh Toothbrush, why are you so mean?    
    Em7    Asus4  D/F#  Cadd9    
You don't know what our love means    
    Em7    Asus4  D/F#  Cadd9    
Oh Toothbrush, why are you so rude?    
    Em7    Asus4  D/F#  Cadd9    
You don't know what we've been through    

Bb/C            Eb/Bb Ab/Bb Eb/Bb     
But then came Table cloth with her smile     
Bb/C            Eb/Bb Ab/Bb Eb/Bb     
She said they had nothing to hide     
Bb/C            Eb/Bb Ab/Bb Eb/Bb     
She said that they were beautiful     
Bb/C            Eb/Bb Ab/Bb Eb/Bb     
She said that they should follow their hearts     

Ab             Db/Ab Eb/Ab Db/Ab      
She wrapped them up in her embrace      
Ab             Db/Ab Eb/Ab Db/Ab      
She gave them warmth and gave them grace      
Ab             Db/Ab Eb/Ab Db/Ab      
She told them not to listen to hate
