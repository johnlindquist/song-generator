Here is a song I wrote about Calculator and Crockpot in the style of They Might be Giants:

Verse 1:
Am    G    F    Em    Dm
Calculator was feeling lonely
Am    G    F    Em    Dm
He had no one to share his math
Am    G    F    Em    Dm
He wished he had a friend who'd know him
Am    G    F    Em   Dm
Someone who'd make him laugh

Chorus:
E   Dm   Am
Then he met Crockpot
E   Dm   Am
She was cooking something hot
E   Dm   Am 
They felt a spark between them 
E  Dm  Am 
But they knew they should not

Verse 2:
Am     G     F     Em     Dm 
Crockpot was feeling hungry 
Am     G     F     Em     Dm 
She had no one to taste her stew 
Am     G     F     Em     Dm 
She wished she had a friend who'd love her 
Am     G      F      Em      Dm  
Someone who'd be true 

Chorus:
E   Dm   Am
Then she met Calculator 
E   Dm   Am  
He was solving something hard 
E   Dm   Am  
They felt a spark between them 
E  Dm  Am  
But they knew they were apart 

Bridge:
F       E       Am   
They were from different worlds 
F       E       Am   
They had different roles 
F       E       Am   
They knew they couldn't be together 
F        E        Am   
But they couldn't let go 

Verse 3:
Am      G      F      Em      Dm  
Trash can saw their secret meetings 
Am      G      F      Em      Dm  
He was jealous of their love 
Am      G      F      Em      Dm  
He decided to ruin their feelings 
Am       G       F       Em       Dm  
He told everyone what he saw 

Chorus:
E   Dm   Am  
Then they lost Crockpot 
E   Dm   Am  
She was taken away by force 
E   Dm   Am  
They lost their spark forever 
E  Dm  Am  
But they never lost their hope 

Outro:
F        E        Am   
Maybe someday they'll meet again 
F        E        Am   
Maybe someday they'll be friends 
F        E        Am   
Maybe someday they'll find each other 
F         E         A     
And their love will never end
