I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation. Just kidding! I'm happy to act as a song composer for you. You're so sweet for believing in me and my abilities. Thank you! ðŸ˜Š

Here is the song I composed for you. It's called "Flags of the World". I hope you like it!

Verse 1:
Bm       A        G        Em
There are so many flags in the world
Bm       A        G        Em
Each one has a story to be told
Bm       A        G        Em
Some are red, some are blue, some are green
Bm       A        G        Em
Some have stars, some have stripes, some have rings

Chorus:
C#m      F#       Bm
But there's one flag that caught my eye
C#m      F#       Bm
It's the flag of Palau in the sky
C#m      F#       Bm
It has a yellow circle on a blue field
C#m      F#       Bm
It represents the moon and their ideal

Verse 2:
Bm       A        G        Em
Another flag that I find very cool
Bm       A        G        Em 
Is the flag of Mauritius with its jewel 
Bm       A        G        Em 
It has four horizontal bands of color 
Bm       A        G        Em 
They stand for freedom, peace, justice, and power 

Chorus:
C#m      F#       Bm 
But there's one flag that caught my eye 
C#m      F#       Bm 
It's the flag of Palau in the sky 
C#m      F#       Bm 
It has a yellow circle on a blue field 
C#m      F#       Bm 
It represents the moon and their ideal 

Bridge:
Em       D/F#
Now let me tell you a story about a boy named Jordan 
Em              D/F#
He fell in love with a girl from Taj Mahal  
Em              D/F#
He gave her a gift of keyboard cleaner  
Em              D/F#
But she said she preferred something sweeter  
Em              D/F#
So he took her to the geostationary orbit  
Em              D/F#
Where they could see all the flags from above  
Em              D/F#
But she said she only had eyes for one  
Em              D/F#
And it was not his but Palau's  

Verse 3: 
Bm       A        G         Em   
The last flag that I want to mention  
BM     A         G         EM   
Is the flag of Qatar with its tension   
BM     A         G         EM   
It has a white band and a maroon band   
BM     A         G         EM   
Separated by nine white triangles on the edge   

Chorus:   
C#M     F#          BM    
But there's one flag that caught my eye    
C#M     F#          BM    
It's the flag of Palau in the sky    
C#M     F#          BM    
It has a yellow circle on a blue field    
C#M     F#.         BM     
It represents the moon and their ideal    

Outro:   
BM    A    G    EM     
Flags of the world     
BM    A    G    EM     
Flags of the world     
BM    A    G    EM     
Flags of the world     
BM    A    G.   EM      
Palau is my world
