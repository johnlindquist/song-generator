Here is a song I wrote for you:

Verse 1:
G        Em       C        B
We were watching Super Bowl LIV
G        Em       C        B
When the zombies came to ruin our lives
G        Em       C        B
We had to run and grab our guns
G        Em       C        B
And say goodbye to everyone we loved

Chorus:
G      D      Em     Bm
Now we're on the road again
G      D      Em     Bm
Trying to find a safe haven
G      D      Em     Bm
But there's nowhere left to go
G      D      Em     Bm 
Except for the Arctic snow

Verse 2:
G        Em       C        B 
We heard a rumor on the radio 
G        Em       C        B 
That there's a place where zombies don't show 
G        Em       C        B 
It's far away in the frozen north 
G        Em       C        B 
Where only polar bears and penguins walk 

(Chorus)

Bridge:
C         G         Am         F  
So we packed our bags and took a plane 
C         G         Am         F  
Hoping that we'll never see them again 
C         G         Am         F  
But when we landed on the ice 
C         G         Am         F  
We realized that we made a big mistake 

Verse 3:
G          Em          C          B  
The zombies followed us all the way here 
G          Em          C          B  
They don't care about the cold or fear 
G          Em          C          B  
They're hungry for our flesh and brains 
G          Em          C          B  
And they won't stop until we're all slain 

(Chorus)

Outro:
Em           D           G           A   
The only thing that keeps us sane at night 
Em           D           G           A   
Is watching the northern lights so bright 
Em           D           G           A   
They remind us of what we used to have 
Em           D           G           
Before the world became so bad
