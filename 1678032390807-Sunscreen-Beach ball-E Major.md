Here is a song I wrote about Sunscreen and Beach ball in the style of They Might be Giants:

Verse 1:
E B A
Sunscreen was feeling lonely on the shelf
E B A
He wanted to go out and have some fun
E B A
But no one ever picked him from the store
E B A
He thought he was too boring for the sun

Chorus:
E C#m G#m A
Then one day he saw a Beach ball bouncing by
E C#m G#m A
She was colorful and shiny and so round
E C#m G#m A
He felt a spark inside his plastic tube 
E C#m G#m A 
He knew he had to meet her somehow

Verse 2:
Sunscreen jumped off the shelf and rolled outside 
He followed Beach ball to the sandy shore 
He caught up with her near a picnic spot 
He said hello and asked her for her name 

Chorus:
She said she was a Beach ball from the park 
She liked to play with kids and dogs all day 
She noticed Sunscreen's label on his side 
She said he looked like someone who could stay 

Bridge:
B F#
They spent the afternoon together in the sun 
B F#
They laughed and talked and shared their hopes and dreams 
B F#
They found they had a lot in common too 
B F#
They both enjoyed photos and cookie cutters

Verse 3:
Sunscreen felt happy for the first time ever 
He thanked Beach ball for being so nice to him 
He asked her if she wanted to be friends 
She said she'd love to see him again 

Chorus:
They made a plan to meet up every week 
They explored different places near and far 
They became inseparable over time 
They were Sunscreen and Beach ball, two bright stars

Outro:
E B A E B A E B A E (fade out)
Sunscreen and Beach ball, two bright stars...
