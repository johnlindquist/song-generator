Here is a song I wrote for you:

```markdown
B  A  E
Jordan is turning eleven today
B  A  E
He loves geography in every way
B  A  E
He knows all the flags of the world by heart
B  A  E
He can tell them apart from the very start

E  C#m  A  B
He wants to travel to every nation
E  C#m  A   B
See the sights and learn their location
E   C#m   A    B 
But he doesn't have a passport or a plane
E   C#m    A    B 
So he uses his imagination

A    B    E     C#m 
He goes to France and waves the tricolor 
A    B     E      C#m 
He goes to Japan and sees the rising sun 
A     B      E       C#m 
He goes to Canada and hugs a maple leaf 
A     B      E  
He goes to Brazil and dances on the beach 

B   A   E  
Jordan is having so much fun 
B   A   E  
Exploring the world one by one 
B   A   E  
He doesn't need a ticket or a visa 
B   A   E  
He just needs his encyclopedia 

E  C#m  A  B
He wants to visit every continent 
See the animals and learn their accent 
But he doesn't have a backpack or a boat 
So he uses his remote control 

A    B    E     C#m 
He goes to Africa and rides an elephant 
A    B     E      C#m 
He goes to Australia and meets a kangaroo 
A     B      E       C#m 
He goes to Antarctica and plays with penguins 
A     B      E  
He goes to Europe and climbs the Big Ben 

B   A   E  
Jordan is having so much fun 
B   A   E  
Exploring the world one by one 
B   A   E  
He doesn't need a guide or a map 
B   A   F#
But he needs to take a nap 

F#
Because tomorrow is another day (another day)   
F#
And he has more places to go (places to go)   
F#
And more flags to show (flags to show)   
F#
And more things to know (things to know)   

E    
Jordan is turning eleven today (today)   
E    
And he loves geography in every way (every way)   
E    
And he knows all the flags of the world by heart (by heart)   
E    
And he can tell them apart from the very start (the start)
