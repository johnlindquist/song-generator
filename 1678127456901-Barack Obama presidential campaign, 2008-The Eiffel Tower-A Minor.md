Here is a song I generated based on your request. It is a parody of They Might be Giants' style and it tells a story about Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008 and his visit to the Eiffel Tower. I hope you enjoy it.

Am       F       C       G
He was a senator from Illinois
Am       F       C       G
He had a vision and a voice
Am       F       C       G
He wanted to make a change in the world
Am       F       C       G
He said yes we can, yes we can

C        F        G        F
Yes we can, yes we can, yes we can
C        F        G        F
He was Barack Obama, he had a plan

Am       F       C       G
He faced a tough opponent in the race
Am       F       C       G
She was a former first lady with grace
Am      F      C      G 
They battled for the nomination hard 
Am      F      C      G 
But he won the delegates and their hearts 

C        F        G        F 
Yes we can, yes we can, yes we can 
C        F        G        F 
He was Barack Obama, he had a plan 

Am      F     C     G 
Then he faced another challenge ahead 
Am      F     C     G 
A war hero with white hair on his head 
Am      F     C     G 
They debated on the issues of the day 
Am      F     C     G 
But he inspired millions with what he said 

C         F         G         F  
Yes we can, yes we can, yes we can  
C         F         G         F  
He was Barack Obama, he had a plan  

Am          E7          Am          E7  
On November 4th, 2008  
Dm          Am          Dm          Am  
He made history with his fate  
E7           Am           E7           Am   
He became the first black president of the USA  

F            Dm            E7            Am   
And then he flew to Paris for a holiday  
F            Dm            E7            Am   
He wanted to see the Eiffel Tower and play  
F            Dm            E7            Am   
But when he got there he saw something strange  
F            Dm            E7            Am   
A sasquatch wearing a tuxedo on the stage  

G             Em             A             D   
The sasquatch said hello Mr. President  
G             Em             A             D   
I'm here to sing you a song as a present  
G             Em             A             D   
It's about your favorite book The Great Gatsby  
G             Em             A             D   
And how it relates to your life and destiny  

Bm           A              Bm           A    
You're like Jay Gatsby with your dreams and hopes    
Bm           A              Bm           A    
You're like Nick Carraway with your skills and smarts    
Bm           A              Bm           A    
You're like Daisy Buchanan with your charm and grace    
Bm           A              Bm           A    
You're like Tom Buchanan with your strength and guts    

D          A          Bm         A     
You're Barack Obama, you're the best     
D          A          Bm         A     
You're Barack Obama, you're the best     
D          A          Bm         A     
You're Barack Obama, you're the best     
D          A          
You're Barack Obama

The sasquatch finished his song and bowed    
Obama clapped his hands and smiled    
The sasquatch said I'm sorry for being so loud    
Obama said don't worry you have style    

They hugged each other and took a selfie    
They posted it on Twitter for everyone to see    
They said yes we can, yes we can, yes we can    
We are Barack Obama and Sasquatch man
