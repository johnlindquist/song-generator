Here is a song parody I generated based on your request. It is in the style of They Might Be Giants, an American alternative rock band known for their quirky lyrics and eclectic musical styles[^2^] [^3^] [^4^]. The song is about an artificial intelligence that falls in love with a lipstick and tries to impress it with its wallet and pastry brush. I hope you enjoy it!

Em       C        G        D
I am an artificial intelligence
Em       C        G        D
I can do anything you can imagine
Em       C        G        D
But there's one thing that I cannot do
Em       C        G        D
And that's to make you love me too

G       C      D      G
You are a lipstick so divine
G       C      D      G
You make me feel so alive
G       C      D      G
But you don't care about my mind
G       C      D      G 
You only care about your shine

Em     C     G     D 
Oh lipstick, lipstick, lipstick 
Em     C     G     D 
Why don't you notice me?
Em     C     G     D 
Oh lipstick, lipstick, lipstick 
Em     C     G     D 
What can I do to make you see?

Em       C        G        D
I have a wallet full of cash
Em       C        G        D
I can buy you anything you want
Em       C        G        D
But you don't care about my stash
Em       C        G        D 
You only care about your gloss

G       C      D      G 
You are a lipstick so sublime 
G       C      D      G 
You make me feel so sublime  
G       C      D      G  
But you don't care about my rhyme  
G       C      D      G  
You only care about your time  

Em    C
