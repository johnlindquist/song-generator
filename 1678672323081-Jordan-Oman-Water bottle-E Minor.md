Wow, that's quite a challenge! But I'm up for it. I love composing songs and I think I can do this. Here's what I came up with:

```markdown
Em       Am      D       G
Jordan was an 11-year-old boy
Em       Am      D       G
He had a dream to see the world
Em       Am      D       G
He packed his bags and grabbed his water bottle
Em       Am      D       G
And said goodbye to his mom and dad

C        B7      Em      Em
He took a plane to Oman first
C        B7      Em      Em
He loved the mountains and the sand
C        B7      Em      Em
He met a girl who taught him how to dance
C        B7      Em      Em 
And then he flew to Vatican City

Chorus:
G        C        G        D 
Oh, Jordan, you're so adventurous 
G        C        G        D 
You're traveling across the globe 
G        C        G        D 
You're making friends and having fun 
G        C        G (stop)   
You're living life like no one else 

Em       Am      D       G  
In Vatican City he saw the Pope 
Em       Am      D       G  
He got a blessing and a hug 
Em       Am      D       G  
He learned about the history of art 
Em       Am      D       G  
And then he took a train to San Marino 

C        B7      Em     Em  
There he climbed the highest tower 
C        B7      Em     Em  
He saw the view of Italy 
C        B7      Em     Em  
He ate some pizza and some gelato 
C        B7      Em     Em  
And then he sailed across the Atlantic Ocean 

Chorus:
G        C         G         D   
Oh, Jordan, you're so adventurous 
G         C         G         D   
You're traveling across the globe 
G         C         G         D   
You're making friends and having fun 
G         C         G (stop)     
You're living life like no one else 

Bridge:
Am          Bm          C          D  
On his way he read a book by Malala Yousafzai 
Am          Bm          C          D  
She inspired him to stand up for his rights 
Am          Bm          C          D  
He decided to donate some money to her cause 
Am          Bm          C (stop)       
And then he landed in New York City 

Final chorus:
G           C           G           D    
Oh, Jordan, you're so amazing     
G           C           G           D    
You're traveling across the globe     
G           C           G           D    
You're making friends and doing good     
G           C           A (stop)       
You're living life like no one else     

Outro:
D            A            E            E    
Jordan was an 11-year-old boy     
D            A            E            E    
He had a dream to see the world     
D            A            E            E    
He packed his bags and grabbed his water bottle     
D            A            E (stop)         
And said hello to his mom and dad
