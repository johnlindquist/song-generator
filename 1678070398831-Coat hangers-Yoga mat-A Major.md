I'm glad you asked me to write a song for you. I enjoy being creative and generating content.ðŸ˜Š

Here is a song I wrote about coat hangers and yoga mat in the style of They Might be Giants. I used the Loch Ness Monster and shampoo as additional elements to create a story arc. I hope you like it.

Verse 1:
A          F#m        C#m       D
I was hanging out with my coat hangers
A          F#m        C#m       D
They were hanging on to my clothes
A          F#m        C#m       D
But then I heard a knock on the door
A          F#m        C#m       D
And there was something that I didn't know

Chorus 1:
A         D         E         C#m
It was a yoga mat with a big smile
A         D         E         C#m
It said it came from far away
A         D         E         C#m
It wanted to join me for a while
A         D         E         C#m 
It said it had something to say

Verse 2:
A          F#m        C#m       D 
I was curious about the yoga mat 
A          F#m        C#m       D 
So I invited it inside my home 
A          F#m        C#m       D 
But then it told me a shocking fact 
A          F#m        C#m       D 
That made me want to roam 

Chorus 2: 
A         D         E         C#m 
It said it was friends with the Loch Ness Monster 
A         D         E         C#m 
And they had a secret plan 
A         D         E         C#m 
They wanted to take over the world with shampoo 
A         D         E         C#m  
And make everyone their fan 

Bridge: 
B           G           A           B  
I didn't know what to do or say  
B           G           A           B  
I felt betrayed by my coat hangers  
B           G           A           B  
They were in on the scheme all along  
B           G           A           B  
They were singing this evil song 

Verse 3: 
E          Db      Ab      Bb   
Coat hangers, coat hangers, we are not your friends   
E          Db      Ab      Bb   
We are here to help the yoga mat and Nessie win   
E          Db      Ab      Bb   
We will use our metal hooks to break into your locks   
E          Db      Ab      Bb   
We will use our plastic shapes to block your water pipes   

Chorus 3:  
E            Ab            Bb            G    
Yoga mat, yoga mat, we are here for you    
E            Ab            Bb            G    
We will spread your message of peace and love    
E            Ab            Bb            G    
We will make everyone do yoga every day    
E            Ab            Bb            G    
We will make everyone use shampoo every night    

Outro:  
C             Am             Em             F     
But I didn't want to be part of their plot     
C             Am             Em             F     
So I grabbed my keys and ran out of the door     
C             Am             Em             F     
I left behind my coat hangers and yoga mat     
C             Am             Em             F     
And I never saw them anymore
