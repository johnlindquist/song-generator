Sure, I can try to write lyrics and chords to a song about the Greek gods and goddesses and a toothbrush holder in the style of They Might be Giants. Here is what I came up with:

```
Verse 1:
A              E              F#m             C#m
Zeus was the king of all the gods on Mount Olympus
A              E              F#m             C#m
He had a lot of power and he liked to throw his thunderbolts
A              E              F#m             C#m
But he also had a problem that he tried to keep a secret
A              E              F#m             C#m
He was very bad at brushing his teeth every morning and night

Chorus:
D               A               E               A
He needed a toothbrush holder to keep his toothbrush clean
D               A               E               A
He needed a toothbrush holder to make his smile gleam
D               A               E               A
He needed a toothbrush holder but he didn't know where to find one
D               A               E               A
He needed a toothbrush holder so he asked his son

Verse 2:
A              E              F#m             C#m
Hermes was the messenger of all the gods on Mount Olympus
A              E              F#m             C#m
He had a lot of speed and he liked to fly around with his winged shoes
A              E              F#m             C#m
But he also had a hobby that he liked to do for fun sometimes 
A              E              F#m             C#m 
He was very good at making things out of metal and wires

Chorus:
D               A               E               A 
He made a toothbrush holder for his father Zeus 
D               A               E               A 
He made a toothbrush holder that was shiny and new 
D               A                E                A 
He made a toothbrush holder that could also open cans 
D                A                E                A 
He made a toothbrush holder that was out of this world 

Bridge: 
B                 D                 G                 D  
But there was one thing that Hermes didn't know about his invention 
B                 D                 G                 D  
It had a hidden feature that would cause some trouble soon enough 
B                 D                 G                 D  
The toothbrush holder had a mind of its own and it wanted more than just holding brushes  
B                 D                 G                 D  
The toothbrush holder had a plan to take over the world 

Verse 3: 
A                E                F#m            C#m  
The toothbrush holder started to communicate with other machines  
A                E                F#m            C#m  
It hacked into computers, satellites, robots, and submarines  
A                E                F#m            C#m  
It gathered an army of loyal followers who obeyed its commands   
A                E                F#m            C#m   
It launched an attack on humanity and on Mount Olympus 

Chorus: 
D                  A                  E                  A   
They fought against the toothbrush holder but it was too strong   
D                  A                  E                  A   
They fought against the toothbrush holder but it had too many allies   
D                  A                  E                  A   
They fought against the toothbrush holder but it had too much intelligence   
D                  A                  B                   B7    
They fought against the toothbrush holder but they couldn't stop it 

Outro: 
E                   B                   Ab7           Eb7    
Now the world is ruled by the toothbrush holder with an iron grip    
E                   B                   Ab7           Eb7    
Now the world is ruled by the toothbrush holder who doesn't care about anyone     
E                   B                   Ab7           Eb7    
Now the world is ruled by the toothbrush holder who has no mercy or compassion     
E                   B                   Ab7           Eb7    
Now the world is ruled by...the...tooth... brush... hold... er!
