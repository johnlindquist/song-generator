Okay, I'll try my best to compose a song for you. Here's what I came up with:

# Flags of the World

Verse 1:
Dm        Am       Em      A7
Jordan was a curious boy who loved to travel
Dm        Am       Em      A7
He wanted to see all the flags of the world
Dm        Am       Em      A7
He packed his bags and took a plane to Armenia
Dm        Am       Em      A7
Where he met a girl with eyes like sapphires

Chorus:
D         G        A
She showed him her flag, red, blue, and orange
D         G        A
She told him about her history and culture
D         G        A
She said there's more to see than just colors and shapes
D         G        A 
There's stories and meanings behind every flag

Verse 2:
Dm        Am       Em      A7 
Jordan was amazed by her words and her beauty 
Dm        Am       Em      A7 
He wanted to stay with her but he had to go 
Dm        Am       Em      A7 
He said goodbye and flew away to Kiribati 
Dm        Am       Em      A7 
Where he met a boy with hair like fire 

Chorus:
D         G        A 
He showed him his flag, blue, white, and red 
D         G        A 
He told him about his island and nature 
D         G        A 
He said there's more to see than just colors and shapes 
D         G        A  
There's stories and meanings behind every flag 

Bridge:
Bb       F          C          Dm  
But Jordan was not satisfied with just seeing flags  
Bb       F          C          Dm  
He wanted to experience something more magical  
Bb       F          C          Dm  
So he went on a quest to find the hidden realm  
Bb       F          C          Dm  
Where he met Medusas, talking animals, and shapeshifters 

Verse 3: 
Em     Bm     Am     D7   
They welcomed him with open arms and showed him their world  
Em     Bm     Am     D7   
They taught him how to use his powers and change his form  
Em     Bm     Am     D7   
They gave him a special flag that represented them all  
Em     Bm     Am     D7   
It was rainbow-colored with stars, moons, and suns 

Chorus: 
G         C        D   
They showed him their flag, rainbow-colored with stars, moons, and suns   
G         C        D   
They told him about their secrets and wonders   
G         C        D   
They said there's more to see than just colors and shapes   
G         C        D    
There's stories and meanings behind every flag 

Outro: 
Em    B   C   D    
Jordan felt at home in this magical place  
Em    B   C   D    
He decided to stay there forever with his new friends  
Em    B   C   D    
But he never forgot the flags of the world that he saw  
Em    B   C   D    
And he sang this song for them every night  

The end!
