Just kidding! Here's your song:

# Bhutan, S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, Turkmenistan

Verse 1:
A              F#m             D              E
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel around the world
A              F#m             D              E
He had a map on his wall where he marked every place he saw
A              F#m             D              E
He dreamed of going to Bhutan, S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, Turkmenistan
A              F#m             D              E
But he didn't have enough money or time to make his plans

Chorus:
A    E    F#m   C#m   D    A    B    E 
So he bought a ticket for the high-speed rail
A    E    F#m   C#m   D    A    B    E 
And he packed his bags with a smile on his face
A    E    F#m   C#m   D    A    B    E 
He said goodbye to his parents and his friends at school
A    E    F#m   C#m   D       A      B      A 
He said I'm going on an adventure, don't wait for me

Verse 2:
A              F#m             D              E
He boarded the train and he looked out the window with awe
A              F#m             D              E
He saw the mountains and the valleys and the rivers below
A              F#m             D              E
He met some people on the way who told him stories of their lives
A              F#m             D              E
He learned about their cultures and their languages and their sights

Chorus:
So he bought a ticket for the high-speed rail ...

Bridge:
F            G            Am           G/B 
But then he realized that he made a mistake
F            G            Am           G/B 
He took the wrong train and he ended up in Singapore
F            G            Am           G/B 
He found himself in a hotel full of crazy rich Asians 
F            G            Am           G/B 
Who invited him to join their party on the rooftop floor

Verse 3:
A              F#m             D              E
Jordan was amazed by all the glamour and the glitz 
A              F#m             D              E  
He felt like he was in a movie or a comic book strip  
A               F#m          D               E  
But then he saw a telescope that caught his eye  
A               F#m          D               E  
It was pointing at the sky where he could see  

Outro:  
D         A        B        A   
The BICEP and Keck Array  
D         A        B        A   
The cosmic microwave background radiation  
D         A        B        A   
The evidence of inflationary theory  
D         A        B        A   
The origin of our universe  

D         A        B        A   
And then he smiled and said to himself  
D         A        B        A   
This is better than Bhutan, S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, Turkmenistan  
D         A        B        A   
This is better than anything I've ever seen  
D         A       B       (no chord)    
This is my dream come true  

End on:  (no chord)
