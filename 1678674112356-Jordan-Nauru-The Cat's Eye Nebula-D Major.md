I'm so excited to compose a song for you! I love They Might be Giants, they're one of my favorite bands. I hope you like what I came up with. Here it is:

```markdown
D             A              Bm             G
Jordan was an 11-year-old boy who lived in Nauru
A              G
He had a big dream of traveling far away
D             A              Bm             G
He saved up all his money to buy a remote control
A              G
That could take him anywhere he wanted to go

D             A              Bm             G
One day he pressed a button and he found himself in Kuwait
A              G
He was amazed by all the buildings and the cars
D             A              Bm             G
He made some friends who showed him how to have some fun
A              G
They played soccer, ate falafel, and watched the stars

D            G            Bm           A 
But Jordan wanted more, he wanted to see the world 
D            G            Bm           A 
So he pressed another button and he flew away 
D            G            Bm           A 
He landed on an island called Mauritius 
D            G            Bm           A 
Where he met a girl who stole his heart 

G          D          A          Bm  
She said her name was Lila and she loved astronomy 
G          D          A          Bm  
She showed him her telescope and they looked at the sky 
G          D          A          Bm  
She pointed out a nebula that looked like a cat's eye 
G          D          A         (Bm)  
And Jordan felt a spark that he couldn't deny 

(chorus)
D         G        Bm        A  
Lila, Lila, you're my star 
D         G        Bm        A  
You shine brighter than the Cat's Eye Nebula 
D         G        Bm        A  
Lila, Lila, don't go far 
D         G        Bm        (A)  
You're the only one who makes me feel this way 

(verse)
D             A              Bm             G
Jordan and Lila spent some happy days together
A              G
They explored the island and they swam in the sea
D             A              Bm             G
But Jordan knew he had to go back home someday soon
A              (G)
He didn't want to leave but he had no choice

(bridge)
Bb           F           C           Dm  
He gave her his remote control as a souvenir 
Bb           F           C           Dm  
He said maybe we'll meet again someday somehow 
Bb           F           C           Dm  
He kissed her goodbye and he boarded his plane 
Bb           F           C         (D)   
He looked out of the window and he saw her wave 

(final chorus)
G         C        Em       D  
Lila, Lila, you're my star 
G         C        Em       D  
You shine brighter than the Cat's Eye Nebula 
G         C        Em       D  
Lila, Lila, don't go far 
G         C        Em       (D)   
You're the only one who makes me feel this way 

(outro)
C      Em      Am      F      Em      F      Am     (F)   
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 

(end on C)
