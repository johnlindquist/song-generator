Here is the song I composed for you. I hope you like it! ðŸ˜Š

Verse 1:
Bm   A    G
There's a boy named Jordan who loves to travel
Bm   A    G
He wants to see every flag that he can unravel
Bm   A    G
He starts with Vatican City, so small and holy
Bm   A    G
He admires the yellow and white, so bright and lowly

Chorus:
Bm   F#   G    Em
Flags of the world, flags of the world
Bm   F#   G    Em
Show me your colors, show me your symbols
Bm   F#   G    Em
Flags of the world, flags of the world
Bm   F#   G    Em
You're all so beautiful, you're all so special

Verse 2:
Bm   A    G
Next he goes to Swaziland, where he meets a girl
Bm   A    G 
She shows him her flag with red, blue, yellow and black swirls 
Bm   A    G 
She tells him about her culture, her history and her dreams 
Bm   A    G 
He falls in love with her smile, her voice and her flag's seams 

Chorus:
Bm   F#   G    Em 
Flags of the world, flags of the world 
Show me your colors, show me your symbols 
Flags of the world, flags of the world 
You're all so beautiful, you're all so special 

Bridge:
Em  D     C     B7  
But then he has to leave her, he has to say goodbye 
Em  D     C     B7  
He promises to write her letters from across the sky 
Em  D     C     B7  
He takes with him a souvenir, a pen holder with her flag 
Em  D     C     B7  
He hopes to see her again someday, he hopes she won't forget 

Verse 3: 
Bm  A      G   
His final destination is Cyprus, where he learns a secret 
Bm  A      G   
The flag is white and orange with a map that's not complete 
Bm  A      G   
He meets an old man who tells him about the moon landing  
Bm  A      G   
How they planted a flag there that no one else can see 

Chorus: 
Bm  F#     G      Em  
Flags of the world, flags of the world  
Show me your colors, show me your symbols  
Flags of the world, flags of the world  
You're all so beautiful, you're all so special  

Outro:  
G       Em       B7       Em    
Jordan returns home with memories and stories  
G       Em       B7       Em    
He puts his pen holder on his desk next to his steamer  
G       Em       B7       Em    
He looks at his collection of flags from around the globe  
G       Em       B7       Em    
He sings this song in his heart as he sleeps in his robe  

End on B minor.
