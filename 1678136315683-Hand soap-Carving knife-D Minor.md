Sure, I can try to write a song about a hand soap and a carving knife in the style of They Might Be Giants. Here is what I came up with:

```markdown
Dm       Gm      A        F
Hand soap and carving knife
Dm       Gm      A        F
They were living in the kitchen
Dm       Gm      A        F
Hand soap was always clean and nice
Dm       Gm      A        F
Carving knife was always itching

Gm       Am      Bb       C
To cut something up into pieces
Gm       Am      Bb       C
To feel the power of his blade
Gm       Am      Bb       C
But hand soap said that's not very nice
Gm       Am      Bb       C 
You should be gentle and well-behaved

Dm       Am      Bb       C 
They might be friends (yeah)
Dm       Am      Bb       C 
They might be foes (no)
Dm       Am      Bb       C 
They might be different as day and night 
Dm              Am         Bb          C 
But they're both essential for your hygiene

Hand soap and carving knife 
They had a lot of arguments 
Hand soap said you should wash your hands 
Carving knife said you should sharpen your edge 

But one day they saw a solar panel 
On the roof of their neighbor's house 
They wondered what it was and how it worked 
So they decided to go check it out 

They might be curious (yeah) 
They might be adventurous (no) 
They might be risking their lives for science 
But they're both eager to learn new things 

Hand soap and carving knife 
They climbed up to the roof somehow 
Hand soap was slippery and soapy 
Carving knife was heavy and pointy 

But when they got there they saw a fire 
It was the ring of fire around the sun 
It was too hot and too bright for them  
So they ran back to their kitchen 

They might be giants (yeah)  
They might be giants (no)  
They might be rain, they might be heat  
They might be frying up a stalk of wheat  

But they're both happy to be alive  
And they learned to appreciate each other  
Hand soap and carving knife  
They're not so different after all
