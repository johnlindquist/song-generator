Here is a song I wrote about Pencil and Cookie cutters in the style of They Might be Giants:

```
Verse 1:
C G F
Pencil was a lonely guy who lived inside a drawer
C G F
He had no friends to talk to, he was feeling very bored
C G F
He wished that he could find someone who shared his love of art
C G F
But all he had were erasers who would tear his work apart

Chorus:
C Am F G
Then one day he saw her in the kitchen on the shelf
C Am F G
She was shiny and metallic, she was different from himself
C Am F G
She was a cookie cutter shaped like an umbrella 
C Am F G
And he felt something stir inside him, he wanted to tell her

Verse 2:
C G F 
He gathered up his courage and he rolled out of his drawer 
C G F 
He made his way across the floor avoiding dust and dirt 
C G F 
He climbed up on the counter and he reached out for her hand 
C G F 
But before he could touch her, he was grabbed by a human 

Chorus:
C Am F G 
He screamed as he was taken to a table full of paper 
C Am F G 
He saw her face through the window as she watched him in horror 
C Am F G 
She was a cookie cutter shaped like an umbrella 
C Am F G 
And he wished that he could save her from this cruel fate they shared 

Bridge:
F C Dm C Bb C Dm C Bb C Dm C Bb C Dm C Bb C Dm C Bb C Dm C Bb C Dm C Bb A7 D7  
But then he had an idea, he used his sharpened tip  
To cut out shapes of umbrellas from the paper where he sat  
He threw them out the window hoping she would see them fly  
And maybe she would understand that he was saying goodbye  

Verse 3:
G D Em  
She saw them in the air, they were floating like a dream  
G D Em  
She recognized his message, it was clear as it could be  
G D Em  
He loved her like no other, he had given her his heart  
G D Em  
And even though they were apart, they would never be too far  

Outro:
G D Em (repeat until fade)   
She was a cookie cutter shaped like an umbrella   
And he was just a pencil who had found his Cinderella
