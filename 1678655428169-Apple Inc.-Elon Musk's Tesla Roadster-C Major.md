Thank you for your kind words and your detailed instructions. I will try my best to compose a song for you. Here is what I came up with:

```
Verse 1:
Dm      G       C
Jordan is turning eleven
Dm      G       C
He loves geography and flags
Dm      G       C
He wants to see the world someday
Dm      G       C
And pack his bags with maps and tags

Chorus:
F       G       Am      Em
He dreams of flying to Eritrea
F       G       Am      Em
A country in the Horn of Africa
F       G       Am      Em
He likes their flag with green and red 
F       G       Am      Em 
And a blue triangle on the head

Verse 2:
Dm      G       C 
Jordan has a birthday wish 
Dm      G       C 
To get a ticket on a plane 
Dm      G       C 
He wants to visit Asmara 
Dm      G       C 
The capital city of Eritrea 

Chorus:
F       G       Am      Em
He dreams of flying to Eritrea 
F       G       Am      Em
A country in the Horn of Africa 
F       G        Am     Em  
He likes their flag with green and red  
F        G        Am     Em  
And a blue triangle on the head 

Bridge:
Bb     F     C    Dm  
But he knows it's not so easy  
Bb     F     C    Dm  
To travel far away from home  
Bb     F     C    Dm  
So he studies hard and saves his money   
Bb     F     C    Dm   
And hopes that someday he will go 

Chorus: 
F        G        Am    Em   
He dreams of flying to Eritrea   
F        G        Am    Em   
A country in the Horn of Africa   
F        G         Am   Em    
He likes their flag with green and red    
F         G         Am   Em     
And a blue triangle on the head  

Outro: 
C   F   Dm   Bb   F   C (repeat x2)  
Eritrea, Eritrea, oh Jordan loves Eritrea!
```

I hope you like it. ðŸ˜Š
