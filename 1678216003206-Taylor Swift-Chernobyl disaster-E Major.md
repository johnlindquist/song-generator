Here is the song I wrote for you. I hope you like it. ðŸ˜Š

```markdown
E        A         C#m       B
She was a pop star with a golden voice
E        A         C#m       B
He was a scientist with a hard choice
E        A         C#m       B
They met in Ukraine on a fateful night
E        A         C#m       B
When everything went wrong at the power site

G#m      C#m       F#m       B
Now they're on the run from the radiation
G#m      C#m       F#m       B
Trying to find a way to escape the nation
G#m      C#m       F#m       B
But they can't deny their love is growing stronger
G#m      C#m       F#m       B 
Even though they know they won't live much longer

A        E         F#m       E 
Taylor Swift and Chernobyl disaster (disaster)
A        E         F#m       E 
They're a match made in heaven or hell (or hell)
A        E         F#m       E 
They don't care about the consequences (consequences)
A        E         F#m       E 
They just want to be together and well (and well)

E        A         C#m       B
She sings him songs to soothe his pain
E        A         C#m       B
He tells her stories of his research gain
E        A         C#m       B 
They find some wyrms and elves along the way
E        A         C#m       B 
Who help them hide from the authorities' sway

G#      C          G          D  
But they know their time is running out fast (out fast)
G#      C          G          D  
They have to make their final moments last (moments last)
G#
So they kiss each other under the glowing sky (glowing sky)
C       
And whisper their goodbyes before they die (before they die)

A        E         F#m       E 
Taylor Swift and Chernobyl disaster (disaster)
A        E         F#m       E 
They're a match made in heaven or hell (or hell)
A        E         F#m       E 
They don't care about the consequences (consequences)
A        E         F # m     E  N.C.   
They just want to be together and well (and well)
