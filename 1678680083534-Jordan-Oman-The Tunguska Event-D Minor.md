# The Tunguska Event

Dm A Bb F
Jordan was an 11-year-old boy who loved to play soccer
Dm A Bb F
He dreamed of traveling around the world and seeing every culture
Dm A Bb F
One day he won a contest for a trip to Equatorial Guinea
Dm A Bb F
He packed his bags and grabbed his ball and boarded a plane with glee

Gm C Dm Am
But little did he know that fate had something else in store
Gm C Dm Am
A cosmic blast that shook the earth like never seen before
Gm C Dm Am
The Tunguska event was about to change his life forever
Gm C Dm Am 
He would end up on an island where he had to be clever

The Tunguska event, oh what a mystery (what a mystery)

The Tunguska event, oh what a history (what a history)
Bb F Gm Dm 
The Tunguska event, oh what an adventure (what an adventure)

The Tunguska event, oh what a wonder (what a wonder)

The plane was hit by debris from an asteroid explosion
Dm A Bb F 
It crashed into the ocean near an island called Comoros
Dm A Bb F 
Jordan was the only survivor, he swam ashore with his ball
Dm A Bb F 
He found himself alone and scared, he didn't know who to call

Gm C Dm Am 
But soon he met some friendly folks who lived on that island nation
Gm C Dm Am 
They welcomed him with open arms and gave him food and education
Gm C Dm Am 
They taught him about their culture and their history and their faith

Gn C Dn An  
But there was still hope for Oman, there was still a way to save it (way to save it)  
Gn C Dn An  
There was a portal hidden somewhere on Comoros that could open it (could open it)  
Gn C Dn An   
All they needed was someone brave enough to go through it with courage (with courage)
