I'm glad you're interested in They Might Be Giants songs. They are a very creative and quirky band that has been making music since 1982[^3^]. They have written songs about many topics, such as science, history, animals, numbers and more[^2^].

I have tried to write lyrics and chords to a song about a toothbrush holder and toothpaste and how they relate in the style of They Might Be Giants. I hope you like it. Here it is:

```
Verse 1:
C
You're my toothbrush holder
G
You keep me safe and dry
F
You're always there for me
G
Every morning and every night

C
I'm your toothpaste tube
G
I make your teeth so clean
F
I give you minty freshness
G
And a sparkling sheen

Chorus:
Am              F             C       G 
We're a perfect pair, we go together well 
Am              F             C       G 
We're a dental duo, we make each other swell 
Am              F             C       G 
We're a happy couple, we have so much fun 
Am              F             C       G 
We're a toothy team, we get the job done 

Verse 2:
C
You're my toothbrush holder
G
You hold me up so high
F
You never let me fall down 
G 
Or get squeezed out by some guy 

C 
I'm your toothpaste tube 
G 
I fill you with delight 
F 
I never run out of flavor  
G  
Or lose my cap at night 

(Repeat chorus)

Bridge:
Dm               G               C      Am  
But sometimes I wonder if you really care  
Dm               G               C      Am  
If you ever notice when I'm not there  
Dm               G               C      Am  
If you ever miss me when I'm gone away  
Dm               G               C      Am  
If you ever think of me during the day  

Verse 3:
C   
You're my toothbrush holder   
G   
You don't have to worry   
F   
I always care for you   
G   
Even when I'm in a hurry   

C   
I'm your toothpaste tube   
G   
You don't have to doubt   
F   
I always notice you    
G    
Even when I'm running out   

(Repeat chorus)

Outro:
C                G                F                G     
We're a perfect pair, we go together well (together well)  
C                G                F                G     
We're a dental duo, we make each other swell (each other swell)  
C                G                F                G     
We're a happy couple, we have so much fun (so much fun)  
C                G                F                G     
We're a toothy team, we get the job done (job done)  

End on C.
