Okay, I'll do my best! Here's what I came up with:

```markdown
Dm       Bb      F       Am
Jordan was an average boy
Dm       Bb      F       Am
He liked to play with his toys
Dm       Bb      F       Am
But he had a secret dream
Dm       Bb      F       Am
To travel far across the sea

Gm       A7      Dm      C
He wanted to see Tuvalu and Tonga
Gm       A7      Dm      C
And maybe even Maldives and Samoa
Gm       A7      Dm      C
He loved to learn about their culture and history
Gm       A7      Dsus4  D 
Especially the Renaissance, oh gee!

Dm       Bb      F       C 
He wished he had a magic toaster 
Dm       Bb      F       C 
That could take him anywhere he wanted to go 
Dm       Bb      F        C 
He would pack his bags and hop inside 
Dm        Bb     F        C 
And say goodbye to his boring life 

Bb        C        Dm     Gm  
But one day he got a surprise 
Bb        C        Dsus4  D  
A letter from Selena Gomez 

She said she was looking for a fan 
To join her on her world tour plan 
She said she heard about his passion for islands 
And she wanted him to be her right hand man 

She said she had a magic toaster 
That could take them anywhere they wanted to go 
She said she needed someone like him by her side 
To make her songs more fun and bright 

Jordan couldn't believe his eyes 
He thought it was a prank or a lie 
But he decided to take a chance 
And reply with his acceptance 

He grabbed his magic toaster from his closet 
He didn't know how it got there but he didn't care 
He wrote a note for his parents and left it on his bed 
And then he jumped into the toaster with Selena instead 

They went to see Tuvalu and Tonga  
And also Maldives and Samoa  
They sang about their culture and history  
Especially the Renaissance, oh gee!  

They had so much fun together  
They felt like they could last forever  
They made some awesome songs along the way  
And they became best friends, hooray!  

All thanks to their magic toaster  
That could take them anywhere they wanted to go  
They found each other in this crazy world  
And they lived happily ever after, boy and girl

The end!
```

I hope you like it! ðŸ˜Š
