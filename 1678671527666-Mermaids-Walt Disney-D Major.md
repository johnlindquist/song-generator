Here is the song I composed for you. I hope you like it!

# The Wizard of Laos

D               A
Jordan was a boy who loved to read
Bm              F#
He dreamed of magic and adventure
G               D
But he lived in a boring town
A               G
Where nothing ever happened

D               A
One day he found a book at the library
Bm              F#
It was about a wizard's tower in Laos
G               D
He opened it and felt a strange sensation
A               G 
He was sucked into the pages

A                G                D 
Now he's in a world of wonder and mystery (The wizard of Laos)
A                G                D 
He has to find his way back home somehow (The wizard of Laos)
A                G                Bm             A 
But he's not alone, he has some friends along the way (The wizard of Laos)
G                A                D 
They're going to help him save the day (The wizard of Laos)

D               A
He met a girl from Armenia
Bm              F#
She was on a quest to find her father
G               D 
He was kidnapped by an evil lord
A               G 
Who wanted his secrets

D               A 
They joined forces with a warrior from Tonga
Bm              F#
He was looking for his lost brother
G               D 
He was taken by a dragon horde
A               G 
Who guarded a treasure

A                G                D 
Together they faced many dangers and enemies (The wizard of Laos)
A                G                D 
They learned about courage and loyalty (The wizard of Laos)
A                G                Bm             A 
They also had some fun and sang some catchy tunes (The wizard of Laos)
G                A                D  
They were inspired by The Hobbit movies (The wizard of Laos)

D               A  
They finally reached the wizard's tower in Laos
Bm              F#  
It was surrounded by a dark forest  
G               D  
They had to fight their way through  
A               G  
With spells and swords  

D               A  
They found the wizard in his chamber  
Bm              F#  
He was old and wise and kind  
G               D  
He told them he could send them back  
A               G   
But they had to make a choice  

A                 G                 D   
Would they stay in this world or go home? (The wizard of Laos)   
A                 G                 D   
Would they leave their friends or their family? (The wizard of Laos)   
A                 G                 Bm             A   
Would they choose magic or reality? (The wizard of Laos)   
G                 A                 D    
What would you do if you were Jordan? (The wizard of Laos)
