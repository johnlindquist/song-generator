Okay, I will try to write lyrics and chords to a song about a dark forest and a wallet in the style of They Might be Giants. Here is what I came up with:

```markdown
Verse 1:
Em   A    D    G
I was walking in the woods one night
Em   A    D    G
When I saw a strange and eerie light
Em   A    D    G
It was coming from a clearing up ahead
Em   A    D    G
So I followed it with curiosity and dread

Chorus:
Bm  F#m  Em  F#
Dark forest, dark forest
Bm  F#m  Em  F#
What secrets do you hide?
Bm  F#m  Em  F#
Dark forest, dark forest
Bm  F#m  Em  F#
Are you on my side?

Verse 2:
Em   A    D    G
In the clearing there was nothing but a hole
Em   A    D    G
And a wallet that was lying on the ground
Em   A    D    G
I picked it up and opened it to see
Em   A    D    G
It belonged to someone from the European Union

Chorus:
Bm  F#m  Em  F#
Dark forest, dark forest
Bm  F#m  Em  F#
What mysteries do you hold?
Bm  F#m  Em  F#
Dark forest, dark forest 
Bm  F#m     Em     F#
Did you witness the Tunguska event?

Bridge:
G     B7      Em      C 
Suddenly I heard a loud explosion 
G     B7      Em      C 
And I felt the earth shake beneath my feet 
G     B7      Em      C 
I looked up and saw a fireball in the sky 
G     B7      C       D 
And I realized I had to run or die 

Verse3: 
Em   A       D        G  
I dropped the wallet and I ran away  
Em   A       D        G  
But I couldn't find my way back home  
Em   A       D        G  
I wandered in the dark for many days  
Em   A       D        G  
Until I found this phone and wrote this song  

Chorus: 
Bm   F#m     Em     F#  
Dark forest, dark forest  
Bm   F#m     Em     F#  
You have haunted me for so long  
Bm   F#m     Em     F#  
Dark forest, dark forest   
Bm         C         Bb         Am   
Please let me go now that you have your song  

Outro:   
Am          Am          Am          Am    
Please let me go now that you have your song   
Am          Am          Am          Am    
Please let me go now that you have your song   
Am          Am          Am          Am    
Please let me go now that you have your song   
Am          
Please let me go...
