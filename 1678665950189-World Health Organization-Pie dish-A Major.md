I've done some research on the flags of the world and I've composed a song for you based on your specifications. Here it is:

A | D | E | D
There's a boy named Jordan who loves to travel
He wants to see every flag that he can unravel
He has a cat named Whisk who likes to tag along
They pack their bags and sing this song

A | F#m | D | C#
Flags of the world, flags of the world
We want to see them all unfurled
Flags of the world, flags of the world
Tell us your stories and your secrets

A | D | E | D
They start their journey in the Marshall Islands
Where they see a blue flag with orange and white bands [^1^]
The star has 24 points for each district [^2^]
Jordan thinks it's very slick

A | F#m | D | C#
Flags of the world, flags of the world
We want to see them all unfurled
Flags of the world, flags of the world
Tell us your stories and your secrets

A | D | E | D
Next they fly to Afghanistan where they meet a friend
He shows them his flag with black, red and green blend [^6^]
The emblem in the center is a mosque with mihrab [^7^]
Jordan feels a connection that he never had

A | F#m | D | C#
Flags of the world, flags of the world
We want to see them all unfurled
Flags of the world, flags of the world
Tell us your stories and your secrets

A|D|E|D 
Then they hop on a plane to Qatar where they land 
They see a maroon flag with white serrated band [^11^] 
The nine points represent an ancient treaty [^12^] 
Jordan thinks it's very neat 

A|F#m|D|C# 
Flags of the world, flags of the world 
We want to see them all unfurled 
Flags of the world, flags of the world 
Tell us your stories and your secrets 

A|D|E|D 
On their way back home they catch a meteor shower 
It's called Perseid and it has amazing power 
They wish upon a star for more adventures soon 
They cuddle with Whisk under the moon 

A|F#m|D|C# 
Flags of the world, flags of the world 
We want to see them all unfurled 
Flags of the world, flags of the world 
Tell us your stories and your secrets
