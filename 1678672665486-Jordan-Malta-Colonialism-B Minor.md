Okay, I'll try my best to compose a song for you. I hope you like it. Here it is:

Bm       A        G        A
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel
Bm       A        G        A
He had a colander on his head like a hat
Bm       A        G        A
He wanted to see the world and all its marvels
Bm       A        G        A
But he didn't have a passport or a map

D      F#m     G      A
So he hopped on a plane to Malta
D      F#m     G      A
Where he met a girl named Alba
D      F#m     G      A
She showed him around the island's beauty
D      F#m     G      A 
But she had a secret that was very shady

Bm    F#m    G    A 
She was a spy for Bosnia and Herzegovina 
Bm    F#m    G    A 
She had a mission to infiltrate Afghanistan 
Bm    F#m    G    A 
She needed Jordan's colander for her plan 
Bm    F#m    G    A 
It was actually a device that could control minds 

G         D          Em         Bm  
Jordan, Jordan, don't trust her, she's lying 
G         D          Em         Bm  
Jordan, Jordan, she's using you for spying 
G         D          Em         Bm  
Jordan, Jordan, your colander is more than it seems 
G         D          Em         Bm  
Jordan, Jordan, wake up from your dreams 

Bm       A        G        A
Jordan followed Alba to Afghanistan 
Bm       A        G        A
He thought they were in love and having fun 
Bm       A        G        A
But she betrayed him and stole his colander 
Bm       A        G        A
And used it to brainwash everyone 

D      F#m     G      A
She wanted to start a new colonialism 
D      F#m     G      A
With Bosnia and Herzegovina as the leader 
D      F#m     G      A
She aimed the colander at the world's leaders 
D      F#m     G      A  
But something went wrong with the transmitter 

Bm    F#m    G    A  
The colander malfunctioned and exploded  
Bm    F#m    G    A  
It sent out a signal that was distorted  
B
