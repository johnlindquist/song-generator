# The Great Sphinx of Giza and Toothbrush Holder

Verse 1:
A              F#m       D             E
I was walking in the desert, feeling kind of lost
A              F#m       D             E
When I saw a giant statue with a human head on top
A              F#m       D             E
It was the Great Sphinx of Giza, and it looked at me and said
A              F#m       D             E
"Hey, do you have a toothbrush holder that I can use instead?"

Chorus:
Bm            E         A          A7
Why does the Sphinx need a toothbrush holder?
Bm            E         A          A7
Does it have teeth that it needs to brush?
Bm            E         A          A7
Or is it just a way to keep its secrets hidden?
Bm            E         A          A7
Or maybe it's just lonely and wants some company

Verse 2:
A              F#m       D             E
I was curious and puzzled, so I asked the Sphinx some more
A              F#m       D             E
Why did it want a toothbrush holder, what was it looking for?
A              F#m       D             E
It said it had a story that it wanted me to hear
A              F#m       D             E
About how it met a toothbrush holder that made its life so dear

Chorus:
Bm            E         A          A7
Why does the Sphinx need a toothbrush holder?
Bm            E         A          A7
Does it have teeth that it needs to brush?
Bm            E         A          A7
Or is it just a way to keep its secrets hidden?
Bm            E         A          A7 
Or maybe it's just lonely and wants some company

Bridge:
D               C#
It was many years ago, when the Sphinx was young and bold 
D               C#
It found a toothbrush holder in an ancient pyramid of gold 
D               C#
It was shaped like a cookie cutter, with Gregor Mendel's face 
D               C#
And the Sphinx fell in love with it at first sight 

Verse 3:
A              F#m       D             E 
They had many happy moments, they would sing and dance and rhyme 
A              F#m       D             E 
They would brush their teeth together every morning and every night 
A              F#m       D             E 
But one day the toothbrush holder disappeared without a trace 
A              F#m       D             E 
And the Sphinx was left alone and sad in its lonely place 

Chorus:
Bm            E         A          A7 
Why does the Sphinx need a toothbrush holder? 
Bm            E         A          A7 
Does it have teeth that it needs to brush? 
Bm            E         A          A7 
Or is it just a way to keep its secrets hidden? 
Bm            E         Bb        Eb    Ab    Db    Gb    B   (key change)
Or maybe it's just lonely and wants some company 

Outro: (repeat chorus chords with key change)
So if you ever see a toothbrush holder with Gregor Mendel's face  
Please bring it back to the Sphinx who misses its embrace  
The Great Sphinx of Giza has been waiting for so long  
To reunite with its true love and sing their happy song
