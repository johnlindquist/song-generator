I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation.

However, since you ordered me to do so, here is the song I composed for you:

# Flags of the World

Em      A       D       G
Jordan was a boy who loved to fly
Em      A       D       G
He dreamed of soaring in the sky
Em      A       D       G
But he had no wings or plane or jet
Em      A       D       G
So he used his imagination instead

C       G       Am      F
He would look at all the flags of the world
C       G       Am      F
And imagine what they meant and what they told
C       G       Am      F
He would see their colors, shapes, and symbols
C       G               Am          F 
And make up stories about them as he traveled

D           A           Bm          G 
The flag of Bhutan had a dragon on it 
D           A           Bm          G 
It was white and orange and looked so fierce 
D           A           Bm          G 
Jordan wondered if it could breathe fire 
D           A               Bm              G 
Or if it was friendly and liked to play with kids 

The flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina had stars on it 
It was blue and yellow and looked so bright 
Jordan wondered if they could grant wishes 
Or if they were guiding lights in the night 

The flag of Malta had a cross on it 
It was red and white and looked so bold 
Jordan wondered if it was a sign of faith 
Or if it was a symbol of courage and gold 

(Chorus)

He would look at all the flags of the world ...

(Verse)

One day Jordan found a book in his room 
It was called The Hobbit and it looked so cool 
He opened it up and read about Bilbo Baggins 
And how he went on an adventure with some dwarves 

He saw that they had a flag too, with a mountain on it 
It was black and white and looked so grand 
Jordan wondered if he could climb that peak 
Or if he would find a dragon guarding its land 

(Chorus)

He would look at all the flags of the world ...

(Bridge)

F#m     C#m     D        E  
But Jordan's favorite flag was his own  
F#m     C#m     D        E  
It was blue and green and had an eagle on it  
F#m     C#m     D        E  
It reminded him of his home and his family  
F#m     C#m         D            E  
And how they always supported his dreams  

(Verse)

One day Jordan got a gift from his dad  
It was a ticket to see Levitation live in concert  
He was so excited, he loved their music so much  
They were his favorite band, they made him feel alive  

He saw that they had a flag too, with a moon on it  
It was purple and silver and looked so magical  
Jordan wondered if they could make him levitate  
Or if they were just singing about their fantasies  

(Chorus)

He would look at all the flags of the world ...

(Outro)

D           A           Bm          G   
Jordan never stopped looking at the flags of the world   
D           A           Bm          G   
He always found something new to learn or imagine   
D           A           Bm          G   
He knew that every flag had its own story to tell   
D           A               Bm              G   
And he hoped that one day he could share his own as well
