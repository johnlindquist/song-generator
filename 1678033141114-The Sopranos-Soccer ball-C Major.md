Here is a song parody about The Sopranos and a soccer ball in the style of They Might be Giants. I hope you enjoy it! ðŸ˜Š

C              G
Tony Soprano was a mobster
Am             Em
He had a lot of power
F              C
But he also had some problems
G              C
That made him sometimes sour

C              G
He went to see a therapist
Am             Em
To talk about his issues
F              C
But he never told her everything
G              C 
Like how he used his tissues

G              F 
One day he found a soccer ball 
C              G 
In his backyard by the pool 
F              G 
He kicked it hard and then he smiled 
C              Am 
It made him feel so cool 

F              G 
He decided to keep playing with it 
C              Am 
He felt like he was free 
F              G  
He didn't care about his family 
Em             F  
Or his criminal activity 

G             F            C  
He just wanted to play soccer all day long 

C               G  
His wife Carmela was worried sick 
Am             Em  
She thought he had gone mad 
F               C  
She tried to talk some sense into him 
G               C  
But he just got very sad 

C               G  
His son A.J. was jealous too 
Am             Em  
He wanted to join his dad 
F               C  
But Tony said it was his ball alone 
G               C  
And that made A.J. very mad 

G               F  
His daughter Meadow was indifferent   
C               G   
She had her own life to live   
F               G   
She didn't care about her father's hobby   
C               Am   
She had nothing left to give   

F               G   
His crew was also losing faith   
C               Am   
They saw him as a joke   
F               G    
They plotted to overthrow him soon   
Em             F    
And maybe even choke   

G             F            C    
They just wanted him to stop playing soccer all day long   

(Bridge)  

Dm            Am           Bb           F    
Tony didn't know what was going on around him     
Dm            Am           Bb           F    
He was too busy having fun with his new friend     
Dm            Am           Bb           F    
He named the ball Wilson after Tom Hanks' movie     
Dm            Am           Bb           F    
He even read him passages from his favorite book     

(Chorus)  

G             F            C    
He just wanted to play soccer all day long     
G             F            C    
He just wanted to play soccer all day long     
G             F            C    
He just wanted to play soccer all day long     
G             F            C    (End on C)      
He just wanted to play soccer all day long
