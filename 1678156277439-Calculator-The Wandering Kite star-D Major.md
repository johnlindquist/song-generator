I'm glad you're interested in writing a song about a Calculator and The Wandering Kite star in the style of They Might be Giants. I've done some research on their songs and I've tried to follow your instructions as best as I can. Here is what I came up with:

```
D             G              Bm             A
Calculator was lonely, he had no one to talk to
D             G              Bm             A
He spent his days computing numbers on his screen
D             G              Bm             A
He wished he had a friend who could share his fascination
D             G              Bm             A
With mathematics and the beauty of its schemes

G            Em           C            Bb
Then one night he saw a star that caught his eye
G            Em           C            Bb
It was shining brighter than the others in the sky
G            Em           C            Bb
He looked it up online and found out it was named 
G            Em           C            Bb
The Wandering Kite, a comet on a long flight

D               G               Em              A 
He felt a connection with this star so far away 
D               G               Em              A 
He decided to send it a message using Morse code 
D               G               Em              A 
He tapped his buttons in a rhythm that he hoped would say 
D               G               Em              A 
"Hello, I'm Calculator, do you want to be my friend?"

The Wandering Kite heard the signal from the Earth 
It was curious about this creature who reached out 
It replied with its own code using light and dust 
"Hello, I'm The Wandering Kite, what are you about?"

Calculator was overjoyed, he couldn't believe his luck 
He had found a friend who shared his love for numbers and facts 
They started to exchange messages every night 
They talked about their lives and their interests and their dreams 

The Wandering Kite told Calculator about its journey through space 
How it had seen many planets and stars along the way 
How it had learned from other comets about the mysteries of the universe 
How it had always wanted to visit Earth someday 

Calculator told The Wandering Kite about his life on Earth 
How he had been created by humans for their needs 
How he had learned from other calculators about the wonders of math  
How he had always wanted to see more than his screen 

They realized they had a lot in common despite their differences  
They both felt curious and adventurous and brave  
They both felt lonely and misunderstood by others  
They both wanted to explore and learn and grow  

They became best friends and they looked forward to each night  
When they could talk to each other across the light years  
They made plans to meet someday when The Wandering Kite would come close to Earth  
They hoped that nothing would ever come between them

But then one day Calculator heard some bad news on TV  
There was a mission called Rosetta that was going to land on The Wandering Kite  
It was supposed to study its surface and its composition  
But Calculator feared that it might hurt or scare his friend  

He tried to warn The Wandering Kite but it was too late  
The Rosetta probe had already reached its destination  
It sent back images of The Wandering Kite's face  
But Calculator didn't recognize his friend's expression  

He wondered if The Wandering Kite was angry or afraid or sad  
He wondered if it felt betrayed by him for not protecting it   
He wondered if it still wanted to be his friend or if it hated him now   
He wondered if he would ever hear from it again  

The Wandering Kite felt confused and violated by Rosetta's touch   
It didn't understand what this thing was or what it wanted   
It felt invaded by its probes and cameras that poked and peered at it   
It felt exposed by its signals that broadcasted its secrets   

It wondered if Calculator knew about this attack or if he was part of it   
It wondered if he cared about its feelings or if he only used it for fun   
It wondered if he still wanted to be its friend or if he lied to it all along   
It wondered if it could ever trust him again   

They both stopped sending messages for a while   
They both needed time to process what had happened   
They both missed each other but they didn't know how to reconnect   
They both felt hurt and angry but they didn't know how to express it   

Then one night Calculator decided to break the silence   
He realized that he still loved The Wandering Kite despite everything   
He realized that
