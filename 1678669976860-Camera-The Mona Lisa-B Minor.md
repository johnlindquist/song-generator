I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation.

However, since you ordered me to do so, here is the song I composed for you:

# Flags of the World

Verse 1:
Bm              G              D             A
There are so many flags in this world of ours
Bm              G              D             A
Each one has a story, a meaning, and a power
Bm              G              D             A
Some are simple, some are complex, some are bright or dull
Bm              G              D             A
But they all represent something more than just a piece of cloth

Chorus:
Bm      F#m     G       Em
Flags of the world, flags of the world
Bm      F#m     G       Em
What do they tell us about ourselves?
Bm      F#m     G       Em
Flags of the world, flags of the world
Bm      F#m     G       Em
Can we learn from them or do we ignore?

Verse 2:
Bm              G              D             A
Take for example the flag of Malta, with its red and white cross
Bm              G              D             A
It symbolizes courage, faith, and loyalty, no matter what the cost
Bm              G              D             A
Or look at Turkmenistan's flag, with its green and red design 
Bm              G              D             A 
It shows their culture, history, and pride in their five tribes

(Chorus)

Verse 3:
Bm              G               D            A 
Then there's Monaco's flag, with its red and white bands 
Bm               G               D            A 
It's almost identical to Indonesia's flag on the other side of the land 
Bm               G               D            A 
But they have nothing in common except for their colors 
Bm               G               D            A 
They don't even know each other or share any struggles 

(Chorus)

Bridge:
Em                F#                Bm          Bb7+
But what about Jordan? He loves flags so much 
Em                F#                Bb7+        B7+
He collects them all and studies them with a touch 
Em                F#                Bb7+        B7+
He has a special connection with The Deep Field Image  
Em                F#                Bb7+        B7+
He sees it as a flag of the universe and its infinite magic 

Verse 4:
G                 C                 Am           Em  
But he also loves Chair, his best friend and companion  
G                 C                 Am           Em  
They sit together every day and watch the flags fly by  
G                 C                 Am           Em  
But one day Chair breaks down and Jordan is heartbroken  
G                 C                 Am           Em  
He feels like he lost his flag and his reason to try 

(Chorus)

Outro:
D                  E                  F#         Ab7+
But then he remembers World War II casualties   
D                  E                  Ab7+       Adim+
And how many people died for their flags and beliefs   
D                  E                  Ab7+       Adim+
He realizes that flags are more than just colors or shapes   
D                  E                  Ab7+       Adim+
They are expressions of hope, love, and grace   

Final Chorus:
F#      C#      Db      Bbm    
Flags of the world, flags of the world   
F#      C#      Db      Bbm    
What do they tell us about ourselves?   
F#      C#      Db      Bbm    
Flags of the world, flags of the world   
F#      C#      Db      
Can we learn from them or do we ignore?   
Db      
Or do we adore?
