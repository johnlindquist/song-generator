Here's the song I composed for you. I hope you like it!

Verse 1:
F#m B E
Jordan was an 11-year-old boy who loved to watch The Simpsons
F#m B E
He dreamed of traveling the world and seeing different nations
F#m B E
He had a map on his wall where he marked all the places he wanted to go
F#m B E
But he never had enough money or time, so he stayed at home

Chorus:
E C#m G#m A
One day he found a suitcase in his backyard, it was shiny and new
E C#m G#m A
He opened it up and saw a note that said "This is for you"
E C#m G#m A
Inside there was a device that looked like an artificial neural network
E C#m G#m A
It said "Press this button and you'll travel to a random country, what do you think?"

Verse 2:
F#m B E 
Jordan was curious and excited, he pressed the button without hesitation
F#m B E 
He felt a jolt of electricity and then he disappeared from his location
F#m B E 
He reappeared in Tuvalu, a tiny island nation in the Pacific Ocean
F#m B E 
He met some friendly people who taught him their culture and language

Chorus:
E C#m G#m A 
He pressed the button again and traveled to another place on his map
E C#m G#m A 
He went to Suriname, a country in South America with rainforests and wildlife habitats
E C#m G#m A 
He learned about their history and diversity, he tasted their food and drinks
E C#m G#m A 
He pressed the button again and wondered where he would go next

Verse 3:
F#m B E 
He landed in Bhutan, a country in the Himalayas with mountains and monasteries
F#m B E 
He saw their flag with a dragon on it, he felt their peace and happiness
F#m B E 
He joined them in their meditation and prayer, he felt a connection with them
F # mB E 
He pressed the button again but nothing happened, he realized it was broken

Chorus:
E C # mG # mA 
He panicked and tried to fix it but it was no use, he was stuck in Bhutan forevermore!
E C # mG # mA 
He cried out loud "Why did this happen to me? I want to go back home!"
E C # mG # mA 
But then he looked around him and saw how beautiful this place was, how kind these people were  
E C # mG # mA  
 He thought maybe this was meant to be, maybe this was his destiny

Outro:  
 F # mB E  
 He decided to stay in Bhutan and make it his new home  
 F # mB E  
 He gave away his suitcase to someone else who wanted to roam  
 F # mB E  
 He lived happily ever after with his new friends and family  
 F # mB E  
 He sang this song every day as a reminder of his journey  

The End!
