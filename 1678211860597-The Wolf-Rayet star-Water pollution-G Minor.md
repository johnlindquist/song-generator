Here is the song I generated for you. I hope you like it. ðŸ˜Š

```
Verse 1:
Am D G
There's a star in the sky that is burning so bright
Am D G
But it won't last forever, it's a Wolf-Rayet
Am D G
It's shedding its mass at a furious rate
Am D G
And one day it will explode in a supernova fate

Chorus:
G C D
Oh, Wolf-Rayet, Wolf-Rayet, what are you doing up there?
G C D
Don't you know that we need you to shine your light so fair?
G C D
Wolf-Rayet, Wolf-Rayet, please don't go away so soon
G C D
We don't want to lose you to a black hole or a neutron

Verse 2:
Am D G
There's a problem on Earth that is making us sick
Am D G
It's the water pollution that is spreading so quick
Am D G
It's killing the fish and the plants and the birds
Am D G 
And it's poisoning our bodies with chemicals and germs

Chorus:
G C D 
Oh, water pollution, water pollution, what are you doing down here?
G C D 
Don't you know that we need you to be clean and clear?
G C D 
Water pollution, water pollution, please stop your dirty flow 
G C D 
We don't want to lose you to a toxic swamp or a sewer

Bridge:
Em Bm Am F 
But maybe there's a way to save them both from doom 
Em Bm Am F 
Maybe we can use our scrying powers to see the truth 
Em Bm Am F 
Maybe we can find Selena Gomez in our dreams 
Em Bm Am F 
And ask her for her wisdom and her magic beams 

Verse 3:
Am D G 
So we close our eyes and we focus really hard 
Am D G  
And we see Selena Gomez shining like a star 
Am D G  
She tells us that she knows how to fix our woes 
Am D G  
She says we have to sing this song with all our souls 

Chorus: (x2)
G C D  
Oh, Wolf-Rayet, Wolf-Rayet, water pollution too 
G C D  
We love you both so much and we want to help you through  
G C D  
Wolf-Rayet, Wolf-Rayet, water pollution yeah  
G C D  
We sing this song for you and we hope you hear our prayer 

Outro: (fade out)
G C Am Em   
Wolf-Rayet...water pollution...Selena Gomez...scrying...
