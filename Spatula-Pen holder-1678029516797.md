I'm glad you're interested in They Might Be Giants songs. They are a very creative and quirky band that has been making music since 1982[^3^]. They have written songs about science, history, animals, numbers and many other topics[^2^].

I have tried to write lyrics and chords to a song about a spatula and a pen holder in their style. I hope you enjoy it. Here it is:

```
Verse 1:
C
There once was a spatula who lived in a drawer
G
He was lonely and bored, he wanted something more
C
He dreamed of adventure, of traveling far away
F              G              C
But he never got out of the kitchen every day

Chorus:
F           G            C
He might be a spatula (spatula)
F           G            C
He might be a spatula (spatula)
F           G            Am
He might be flat, he might be thin
F             G             C
He might be flipping burgers or pancakes

Verse 2:
C
One day he saw a pen holder on the desk
G
She was shiny and colorful, she made him impressed
C
He wanted to talk to her, to ask her for her name
F              G              C 
But he didn't know how to reach her or what to say

Chorus:
F           G            C 
She might be a pen holder (pen holder)
F           G            C 
She might be a pen holder (pen holder)
F           G            Am 
She might be round, she might be tall 
F             G             C 
She might be holding pens or pencils 

Bridge:
Am               F               C               G 
They were so different, they lived in separate worlds 
Am               F               C               G 
But they felt something special, they wanted to be heard 

Verse 3:
C 
So they decided to take a chance and make a move 
G 
They waited for the right moment when no one would see them groove 
C 
They met in the hallway when everyone was asleep 
F              G              C  
And they danced and they sang and they felt so free 

Chorus: 
F           G            C  
They might be together (together) 
F           G            C  
They might be together (together) 
F           G            Am  
They might be happy, they might be sweet  
F             G             C  
They might be spatula and pen holder 

Outro:  
C   F   Am   F   Am   F   Am   F   Am   F   Am   F   
Spatula and pen holder...spatula and pen holder...spatula and pen holder...
