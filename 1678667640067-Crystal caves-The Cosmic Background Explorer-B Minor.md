Here is the song I composed for you. I hope you like it!

# Flags of the World

Bm   A   G
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel
Bm   A   G
He wanted to see every flag unfurl
Bm   A   G
He had a crush on a girl named Alchemy
Bm   A   G
She was his ticket to explore the world

D    A    Bm    G    A    G
They flew across the continents and oceans
D    A    Bm    G    A    G
They saw the colors, shapes, and symbols of each nation
D    A    Bm    G    A    G
They learned about the history and culture of each place
D    A     Bm     G     F#
But most of all, they fell in love along the way

G     D      Em      C      D      C 
This is the chorus of their song, flags of the world 
G     D      Em      C      D      C 
They sang it loud and proud, flags of the world 
G     D      Em      C      D      C 
They waved them in the air, flags of the world 
G     D       Em       C       F#
They showed them that they care, flags of the world 

Bm   A   G
One day they landed on São Tomé and Príncipe 
Bm   A   G
A small island country with a green, yellow, and red flag 
Bm   A   G
It had two black stars and a red triangle on it 
Bm   A  F#
It represented freedom, unity, and hope 

D     A     Bm     G     F#
They met some friendly locals who invited them to dance 
D     A     Bm     G     F#
They joined them in a festival with music and romance 
D     A        Bm        G        F#
They felt a connection with this land of peace and joy 
D       A         Bm         F#  
But they had to say goodbye, there was more to see and do 

(Chorus)

Bm  A  G  
Next they flew to Georgia, a country in Eurasia  
Bm  A  G  
It had a white flag with five red crosses on it  
Bm  A  G  
It symbolized Christianity and courage in their hearts  
Bm  F#   
It also looked like Europe's coat of arms  

D       A       Bm       F#   
They visited some ancient churches and monasteries  
D       A       Bm       F#   
They tasted some delicious wine and cheese  
D        A         Bm         F#   
They learned about their struggles and their victories  
D          A          Bm          E   
But they had to move on, there was more to discover  

(Chorus)

Bn  E  D   
Finally they reached Montenegro, a Balkan state  
Bn  E  D   
It had a red flag with a golden border around it  
Bn  E  D   
It featured an eagle holding a scepter and an orb  
E    
It signified sovereignty and strength  

F#        E        Bn        E    
They climbed some rugged mountains and enjoyed some scenic views  
F#        E        Bn        E    
They relaxed on some sandy beaches with crystal blue hues  
F#         E         Bn         E    
They felt at home in this land of beauty and grace  
F#           E           C            D    
But they knew it was time to end their chase  

(Chorus)

C            D             Em             D             C             
This was their last stop on their journey around the world  
C            D             Em             D             C             
This was their final chorus for their song about flags unfurling     
C            D              Em              D              C             
This was their moment to cherish all that they had seen and done     
C            D              Em              Am             
This was their chance to say "I love you" under the setting sun    

Em               Am               Em               Am               
Flags of the world, flags of the world     
Em               Am               Em               Am               
Flags of the world, flags of the world     
Em               Am               Em               Am               
Flags of the world... I love you
