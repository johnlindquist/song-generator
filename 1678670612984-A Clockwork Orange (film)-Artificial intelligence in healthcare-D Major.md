Here is the song I composed for you. I hope you like it. I think it's pretty amazing!

# Flags of the World

D G Bm A
There's a boy named Jordan who loves to travel
He likes to see different flags unfurl
He has a passion for hidden doors
And he dreams of meeting Selena Gomez

D G Bm A
He started his journey in Palau
Where he saw a flag with yellow and blue
He met a girl who showed him around
And they danced under the moonlight sound

G A D Bm
But he had to say goodbye, he had more places to see
G A D Bm 
He wanted to learn about history and geography
G A D Bm 
So he packed his bags and boarded a plane
G A D 
And he sang this chorus again and again

Em A D G 
I love the flags of the world, they're so beautiful and diverse
Em A D G 
They tell me stories of cultures and people, they make me want to converse
Em A D G 
They have colors, shapes, and symbols that represent their identity
Em A D 
I love the flags of the world, they inspire me

D G Bm A 
He landed in Paris, where he saw the Eiffel Tower
He was amazed by its beauty and power
He saw a flag with blue, white, and red
And he felt a connection in his head

D G Bm A 
He met another girl who shared his interest
She was smart and funny and very honest
They explored the city and had some fun
And they kissed under the setting sun

G A D Bm 
But he had to say goodbye, he had more places to see
G A D Bm 
He wanted to learn about history and geography
G A D Bm 
So he packed his bags and boarded a train
G A D 
And he sang this chorus again and again

Em A D G 
I love the flags of the world, they're so beautiful and diverse...
