Sure, I can try to write lyrics and chords to a song about a The Brooklyn Bridge and Umbrella in the style of They Might be Giants. Here is what I came up with:

```
Verse 1:
A              E              F#m             C#
I was walking on the Brooklyn Bridge one rainy day
A              E              F#m             C#
When I saw a lonely umbrella lying by the way
A              E              F#m             C#
It was red and blue and yellow, like a piece of art
A              E              F#m             C#
And it seemed to be inviting me to take it from the start

Chorus:
Bm            E               A
So I picked it up and opened it above my head
Bm            E               A
And I felt a sudden change in how I saw things instead
Bm            E               A
The umbrella had a power that I could not explain
Bm            E               A
It made me see the world in a different way

Verse 2:
A              E              F#m             C#
The umbrella took me places that I'd never seen before
A              E              F#m             C#
It showed me all the secrets of the city and its lore
A              E              F#m             C#
We flew over skyscrapers and we dived under the sea
A              E              F#m             C#
We met some friendly dolphins and we sang in harmony

Chorus:
Bm            E               A
So I picked it up and opened it above my head
Bm            E               A
And I felt a sudden change in how I saw things instead
Bm            E               A
The umbrella had a power that I could not explain
Bm            E               A
It made me see the world in a different way

Bridge:
D                G                D                G 
But then one day, the umbrella said it had to go 
D                G                D                G 
It said it had a mission that only it could know 
D                G                D                G 
It said goodbye and thanked me for being its friend 
D                G                D                G 
And then it flew away into the wind 

Verse 3:
A              E              F#m             C#
I was sad to lose the umbrella that had changed my life 
A              E              F#m             C#
But I was glad to have shared with it some moments of delight 
A              E              F#m             C#
I still walk on the Brooklyn Bridge sometimes when it rains 
A              E              F#m             C#
And I hope to see another umbrella someday again 

Chorus:
Bm            E               A
So I picked it up and opened it above my head 
Bm            E               A
And I felt a sudden change in how I saw things instead 
Bm            E               A (hold)
The umbrella had a power that I could not explain 
Bm            (hold)          (pause)
It made me see...the world...in...a different way!
