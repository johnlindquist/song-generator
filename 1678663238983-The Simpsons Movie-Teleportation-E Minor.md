Here is the song I composed for you:

```
Em      B       C       Am
Jordan is turning eleven today
Em      B       C       Am
He loves geography in every way
Em      B       C       Am
He knows all the flags of the world by heart
Em      B       C       Am
He can tell them apart from the very start

C      Am     G      F
But he has a secret wish 
C      Am     G      F
That he never told anyone 
C      Am     G      F
He wants to see them all for real 
C      Am     G      F
And have some fun 

Em    Am    G    F
So he sings this song 
Em    Am    G    F
Hoping it will come true 
Em    Am    G    F
He wants to teleport around 
Em    Am    G    F
And see something new 

Em        B         C         Am  
Jordan, Jordan, fly away with me 
Em        B         C         Am  
Let's go to Kyrgyzstan and see the red sun 
Em        B         C         Am  
Jordan, Jordan, don't be afraid to dream 
Em        B         C         Am  
You can do anything you want when you're eleven 

(Repeat chorus)

Em      B       C       Am  
One day he found a magic ring 
Em      B       C       Am  
It was hidden in his birthday cake 
Em      B       C       Am  
It had a button that said "press me" 
Em      B       C       Am  
And he couldn't wait 

C      Am     G      F  
He put it on his finger 
C      Am     G      F  
And pressed it with a smile 
C      Am     G      F  
Suddenly he disappeared 
C      Am     G      F  
In a flash of light 

(Repeat chorus)

(Bridge)
Dm          Em          Dm          Em   
He traveled to many places and saw many things 
Dm          Em          Dm          Em   
He met new people and learned new words to sing 
Dm          Em          Dm          Em   
But he always came back home at the end of the day 
Dm          Em          Dm          Em   
Because he knew that's where his family and friends would stay 

(Repeat chorus twice)

(Outro)
Am           Em           D           C   
Jordan is happy with his life now 
Am           Em           D           C   
He still loves geography but he also loves how 
Am           Em           D           C   
He can explore the world with his magic ring 
Am           Em           D           C   
And he still sings this song when he's feeling like flying 

Jordan, Jordan, fly away with me ...
