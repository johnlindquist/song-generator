This is a challenging task, but I will try my best. Here is a song I wrote about The Renaissance and Jaws (film) in the style of They Might be Giants. I hope you enjoy it.

Bm       G        D         A
In the 15th century, there was a rebirth
Bm       G        D         A
Of art and science and philosophy
Bm       G        D         A
But little did they know that in the ocean deep
Bm       G        D         A
There lurked a menace that would make them weep

G        D        Em        C
It's Jaws, Jaws, Jaws, Jaws
G        D        Em        C
The shark that never sleeps or pauses
G        D        Em        C
It's Jaws, Jaws, Jaws, Jaws
G        D      C      G 
The terror of the seas

Bm       G        D         A 
Leonardo da Vinci painted Mona Lisa's smile
Bm       G        D         A 
But he couldn't paint the horror that was coming for his isle
Bm       G        D         A 
Galileo looked at stars and planets with his scope
Bm       G        D         A 
But he couldn't see the danger that would dash his hopes

G        D        Em        C 
It's Jaws, Jaws, Jaws, Jaws 
The shark that never stops or pauses 
G        D        Em        C 
It's Jaws, Jaws, Jaws, Jaws 
The nightmare of the seas 

Bm       G        D         A 
Michelangelo sculpted David out of stone 
Bm       G
