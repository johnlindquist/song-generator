This is a challenging task, but I will try my best to write a song about the history of China and keyboard cleaner in the style of They Might be Giants. Here is what I came up with:

```markdown
D A Bm F#m
China has a long and rich history
D A Bm F#m
It goes back for over four thousand years
D A Bm F#m
They invented many things like silk and paper
D A Bm F#m
And gunpowder that made some people cheer

G D A E
But sometimes they also had some troubles
G D A E
Like wars and famines and invasions too
G D A E
They had different dynasties that ruled them
G D A E 
Some were good and some were not so cool

A D E D 
This is a song about China and keyboard cleaner (keyboard cleaner)
A D E D 
Two things that you might not think go together (go together)
A D E D 
But they both have something interesting to offer (to offer)
A D E C#
So let's learn more about them in this song

D A Bm F#m 
Keyboard cleaner is a handy product
D A Bm F#m 
It helps you keep your gadgets nice and clean
D A Bm F#m 
You can use a brush or gel or vacuum
D A Bm F#m 
Or even compressed air if you're keen

G D A E 
But sometimes you might also face some problems
G D A E 
Like running out of battery or power cord
G D A E 
Or getting some stains that are hard to remove them
G D A E 
Or accidentally damaging your keyboard

A D E D 
This is a song about China and keyboard cleaner (keyboard cleaner)
A D E D 
Two things that you might not think go together (go together)
A D E D 
But they both have something interesting to offer (to offer)
A D C#
So let's learn more about them in this song

F#7 G7 C7 G7 C7 G7 C7 G7 C7 G7 C7 G7 C7 G7 C7 G7 C#
Bridge: Now you might be wondering what's the connection between these two topics?
Well, here's a little fact that might surprise you: China is one of the largest producers of keyboard cleaners in the world!
They export millions of units every year to different countries and markets!
So next time you use your keyboard cleaner, remember that it might have come from China!
