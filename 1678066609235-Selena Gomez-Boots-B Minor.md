Here is a song I wrote for you:

Bm  A   G   F#
Selena Gomez was feeling lonely
Bm  A   G   F#
She needed someone to keep her company
Bm  A   G   F#
She went online and ordered a pair of boots
Bm  A   G   F#
But she didn't know what she was getting into

Em  D   C   Bm
Boots were not just ordinary footwear
Em  D   C   Bm
They had a secret that they wanted to share
Em  D   C   Bm
They were alive and they could talk and sing
Em  D   C   Bm
And they had a plan to make Selena their queen

G    A    Bm    Em
Boots said: We love you Selena Gomez
G    A    Bm    Em
We want to be with you forever more
G    A    Bm    Em
We'll take you to our home planet Bootopia
G    A    Bm    Em 
Where you'll rule with us and have it all

Bm  A   G   F#
Selena Gomez was surprised and scared 
Bm  A   G   F#
She didn't know how to react or what to say 
Bm  A   G   F#
She tried to run but the boots held on tight 
Bm  A   G   F#
They said: Don't worry, we'll make everything alright 

Em  D   C   Bm 
Boots explained: We're not from Earth, you see 
Em  D   C   Bm 
We're from a distant galaxy 
Em  D   C     B  
We came here long ago by accident 
Em      D     C     B  
And we evolved into intelligent beings 

G    A    Bm    Em  
Boots said: We love you Selena Gomez 
G    A    Bm    Em  
We want to be with you forever more 
G      A      B       Em  
We'll take you to our home planet Bootopia 
G      A      B       Em   
Where you'll rule with us and have it all 

B     E     F#     Ab   
Selena Gomez thought about her life 
B     E     F#     Ab   
She wondered if she was happy or not 
B     E     F#     Ab   
She realized she had nothing left to lose 
B     E     F#     Ab   
And maybe the boots were telling the truth 

C#       Eb       Ab        Db  
Selena said: I love you too, Boots 
C#       Eb       Ab        Db  
I want to be with you forever more 
C#       Eb       Ab        Db  
Let's go to your home planet Bootopia 
C#       Eb       Ab        Db  
Where I'll rule with you and have it all 

Ab Eb Db Cb (x4)

Ab Eb Db Cb    
The end!
