# The Adventures of Jordan

Verse 1:
Gm    Eb    Bb    F
Jordan was an average boy
Gm    Eb    Bb    F
Living in Kuwait City
Gm    Eb    Bb    F
He loved to play his keyboard
Gm    Eb    Bb    F
And watch sci-fi on TV

Chorus:
Gm   D   Am   Em
But he had a secret dream
Gm   D   Am   Em
To explore the galaxy
Gm   D   Am   Em
He wished upon a shooting star
Gm   D   Am  Em  Gm (hold)
And then he fell asleep

Verse 2:
Gm    Eb    Bb    F
The next morning he woke up 
Gm    Eb    Bb     F 
In a spaceship made of tin 
Gm     Eb     Bb      F 
With a friendly alien crew 
Gm      Eb      Bb       F 
Who said they were his kin 

Chorus:
Gm   D   Am   Em  
They told him he was chosen 
Gm     D     Am     Em  
To join their interstellar quest 
Gm      D       Am       Em  
To find the legendary monster 
 Gm      D       Am  Em  Gm (hold)   
That lived in Loch Ness 

Bridge:
C        G        A        D  
They traveled across the universe 
C         G         A          D  
From Djibouti to Bosnia and Herzegovina 
C         G          A          D  
They saw amazing sights and wonders 
C         G          A           D (hold)  
But nothing like the Eagle Nebula 

Verse 3: 
 Gm     Eb      Bb       F   
There they found a giant portal 
 Gm      Eb       Bb        F   
That led them to another dimension 
 Gm       Eb        Bb         F   
Where they finally met the monster 
 Gm        Eb        Bb         F   
Who was friendly and had good intentions 

Chorus: 
 Gm     D      Am      Em   
He invited them to his home 
 Gm       D        Am       Em   
Where he showed them his collection 
 Gm        D         Am         Em   
Of keyboards from different planets 
 Gm        D         Am  Em  C (hold)   
And played them his favorite selection 

Outro:  
 C           C/B            C/A            C/G    
Jordan felt happy and fulfilled  
 C           C/B            C/A            C/G    
He had found his true family  
 C           C/B            C/A            C/G    
He decided to stay with them forever  
C           C/B            C/A            C/G (hold)    
And explore the galaxy
