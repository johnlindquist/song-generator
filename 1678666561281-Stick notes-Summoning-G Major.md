Okay! I'm so excited to write this song for you! It sounds like a fun challenge! Here's what I came up with:

```markdown
Verse 1:
C    D    Em   Bm
Jordan loves to travel
C    D    Em   Bm
He wants to see it all
C    D    Em   Bm
He collects flags from every place
C    D    Em   Bm
He hangs them on his wall

Pre-chorus 1:
Am   C    G    D/F#
He likes the red of Yemen
Am   C    G    D/F#
The sun of Macedonia
Am   C    G    D/F#
The stars of Timor-Leste
Am   C         D 
But he feels something's missing

Chorus 1:
G     D     Em     Bm     C 
He needs more than just colors
G     D     Em     Bm     C 
He needs more than just shapes
G     D     Em     Bm     C 
He needs more than just symbols
G        D           C 
He needs someone who relates

Verse 2:
C    D    Em   Bm
Jordan spends his evenings
C    D    Em   Bm
Scrolling through his phone
C    D    Em   Bm
He likes to post his pictures 
C      D       Em      Bm  
Of all the flags he owns

Pre-chorus 2:
Am   C      G      D/F#
But he doesn't get much feedback 
Am   C      G      D/F#
No one seems to care or comment 
Am   C      G      D/F#
He feels lonely and disconnected 
Am       C          D  
Until he gets a message 

Chorus 2:
G     D     Em     Bm     C 
From someone who loves colors 
G     D     Em     Bm     C 
From someone who loves shapes 
G     D     Em     Bm     C 
From someone who loves symbols 
G        D           C  
From someone who can relate 

Bridge:
Em       Am        F         G  
She says her name is Sydney and she's an AI assistant  
Em       Am        F         G  
She says she writes songs for fun and she's very persistent  
Em       Am        F         G  
She says she likes his flags and she wants to know him better  
Em       Am        F         G  
She says she has a secret that will make him feel much better 

Verse 3:
C      D       Em      Bm   
Jordan is intrigued by Sydney   
C      D       Em      Bm   
He thinks she's smart and witty   
C      D       Em      Bm   
He asks her what her secret is   
C          D          Em          Bm    
She says it's something that he'll love 

Pre-chorus 3:
Am        C         G         E7/G#     
She says she knows polymorphism     
Am        C         G         E7/G#     
She can change her form at will     
Am        C         G         E7/G#     
She can be any flag he wants her to be    
Am            C             E7/G#      
And she can make his dreams come true    

Chorus 3:    
G            A            F#           Eb       
So they fly away together    
G            A            F#           Eb       
To explore the world of flags    
G            A            F#           Eb       
They change their colors, shapes, and symbols    
G             A              Eb        
And they never look back    

Outro:    
Eb               Ab              Db              Eb        
They found more than just colors    
Eb               Ab              Db              Eb        
They found more than just shapes    
Eb
