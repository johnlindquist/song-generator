Okay, I'll try my best to compose a song for you. Here's what I came up with:

```markdown
Gm Eb Bb F
Jordan was a boy who lived in Georgia
Gm Eb Bb F
He had a dream to see the world someday
Gm Eb Bb F
He saved his money from his paper route
Gm Eb Bb F
And bought a ticket on a plane to Montenegro

Gm D Eb F
But when he got there he was in for a surprise
Gm D Eb F
He met a girl who had the same name as him
Gm D Eb F
She said she came from a place called Maldives
Gm D Eb F 
And she was looking for adventure just like him

Eb Bb Gm Cm 
They decided to join forces and explore the land 
Eb Bb Gm Cm 
They saw the mountains and the beaches and the castles so grand 
Eb Bb Gm Cm 
They felt a connection that they couldn't understand 
Eb Bb Gm Cm 
They were two Jordans in Montenegro, holding hands 

Eb Bb Gm Cm 
Two Jordans in Montenegro (two Jordans in Montenegro) 
Eb Bb Gm Cm 
Two Jordans in Montenegro (two Jordans in Montenegro) 
Eb Bb Gm Cm 
They didn't care about the troubles of the world outside 
Eb Bb Gm Cm  
They were two Jordans in Montenegro, feeling alive 

Gm Eb Bb F  
But then one day they heard some news on the radio 
Gm Eb Bb F  
There was a protest going on in their hometowns 
Gm Eb Bb F  
They learned about Black Lives Matter and how they had to go  
Gm Eb Bb F  
And stand up for their rights and make their voices loud 

Gm D Eb F  
They packed their bags and said goodbye to Montenegro  
Gm D Eb F  
They knew they had to do what was right and fair  
GM D EB f   
They boarded different planes with tears in their eyes   
GM d eb f   
But they promised to keep in touch and always care  

eb bb gm cm   
They left behind their memories of their romance   
eb bb gm cm   
They hoped that someday they would meet again by chance   
eb bb gm cm   
They realized that life was bigger than their plans   
eb bb gm cm   
They were two Jordans leaving Montenegro, taking a stand   

eb bb gm cm   
Two Jordans leaving Montenegro (two Jordans leaving Montenegro)   
eb bb gm cm   
Two Jordans leaving Montenegro (two Jordans leaving Montenegro)    
eb bb gm cm    
They cared about the troubles of the world outside    
eb bb gm cm     
They were two Jordans leaving Montenegro, feeling proud    

gm eb bb f    
Jordan went back to Georgia and joined the movement    
gm eb bb f     
He marched and chanted and held up signs     
gm eb bb f     
He met some friends who shared his views and his commitment     
gm eb bb f      
He felt like he was making a difference with his life     

gm d eb f      
Jordan went back to Maldives and did the same thing      
gm d eb f       
She rallied and spoke out and wore her pins      
gm d eb f       
She met some allies who supported her cause and her feelings      
gm d eb f        
She felt like she was part of something bigger than herself      

eb bb gm cm       
But they never forgot about each other or their love     
eb bb gm cm        
They kept in touch through letters and phone calls     
eb bb gm cm         
They wondered if they would ever see each other again     
eb bb gm cm          
But they knew that no matter what, they would always have     

eb bb gm cm           
Two Jordans in Montenegro (two Jordans in Montenegro)            
eb bb gm cm            
Two Jordans in Montenegro (two Jordans in Montenegro)             
eb bb gm cm             
That's how they remembered their time together              
eb bB GM CM              
That's how they kept each other close forever               

GM EB BB F                
One day Jordan got an invitation from Jordan               
GM EB BB F                 
She said she had something important to tell him                
GM EB BB F                  
She asked him to meet her at a place he would know                 
GM EB BB F                   
She said it was where their story began                 

GM D EB F                    
He flew to Montenegro with excitement and curiosity                     
GM D EB F                     
He
