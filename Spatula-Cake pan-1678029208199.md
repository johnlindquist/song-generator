I'm glad you're interested in They Might Be Giants songs. They are a very creative and quirky band that has written songs about many topics, such as science, history, animals, and even numbers. I have tried to write a song about a spatula and a cake pan in their style. Here it is:

```markdown
Verse 1:
C
I am a spatula
G
I flip the pancakes on the griddle
F
I am so flexible and thin
G
But sometimes I feel so little

C
You are a cake pan
G
You bake the cakes in the oven
F
You are so sturdy and strong
G
But sometimes you feel unloved

Chorus:
Am              F              C       G 
We are so different but we belong together 
Am              F              C       G 
We are both useful in our own way 
Am              F              C       G 
We are both metal but we have different shapes 
Am              F              C       G 
We are both part of the kitchenware

Verse 2:
C
You see me flipping eggs and bacon 
G
And you wish you could join me on the stove 
F
But you know you're not made for that kind of heat 
G
So you stay inside your drawer alone 

C
I see you baking cakes and pies 
G
And I wish I could join you in the oven 
F
But I know I'm not made for that kind of sweet 
G
So I stay on the counter with nothing 

(Repeat chorus)

Bridge:
Dm               G               C        Am  
But one day we'll find our perfect match 
Dm               G               C        Am  
Someone who will appreciate us for who we are 
Dm               G               C        Am  
Maybe it's a whisk or a rolling pin 
Dm               G               E        E7  
Or maybe it's someone who's not too far 

Verse 3:
C                G                F                G  
Then one day you see me on a plate with a slice of cake 
C                G                F                G  
And you realize that we have something in common after all 
C                G                F                G  
We both like to make people happy with our tasty treats 
C                G                F      (pause)    C   
And we both like to be part of a meal 

(Repeat chorus)

Outro:
C                 G                 F                 G  
We are a spatula and a cake pan and we belong together (x4)
