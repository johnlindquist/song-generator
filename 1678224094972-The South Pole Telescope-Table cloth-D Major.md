Here is a song I wrote for you. I hope you like it. ðŸ˜Š

```markdown
D             A
I was working at the South Pole Telescope
Bm            G
Looking for signs of cosmic inflation
D             A
When I saw a table cloth on the ground
Bm            G
It was red and white and very round

A              Bm
I picked it up and wondered who left it there
G              A 
Maybe it was a prank or a polar bear
D              A 
But then I noticed something strange and cool
Bm             G 
The table cloth was actually a portal

D      Bm     F#m    G 
To another dimension far away
D      Bm     F#m    G 
Where everything was made of clay
D      Bm     F#m    G 
And everyone played keyboard all day
D      Bm     F#m    G 
And sang songs about Star Wars in a funny way

D             A 
I stepped through the portal with curiosity
Bm            G 
And found myself in a clay city
D             A 
There were clay people and clay cars
Bm            G 
And clay buildings and clay stars

A              Bm 
They welcomed me with smiles and hugs
G              A 
And gave me some clay mugs
D              A 
They said they were fans of the South Pole Telescope
Bm             G 
And they wanted to meet me for a long time

(Chorus)

D             A  
They took me to their keyboard club
Bm            G  
Where they played tunes that made me bob  
D             A  
They sang about Luke and Leia and Han  
Bm            G  
And Darth Vader and Yoda and Obi-Wan  

A              Bm  
They asked me to join them on the stage  
G              A   
And handed me a keyboard that looked like a cage  
D              A   
I played along with their Star Wars songs  
Bm             G   
And felt like I belonged  

(Chorus)

D             A    
But then I remembered my telescope job    
Bm            G     
And how I had to go back to Earth    
D             A     
I told them I had to leave soon    
Bm            G     
And they looked at me with sadness    

A              Bm     
They said they understood my situation    
G              A      
But they hoped I would visit again    
D              A      
They gave me a clay souvenir    
Bm             G      
A table cloth with their names on it    

(Chorus)

D             A       
I thanked them for their hospitality       
Bm            G        
And hugged them goodbye        
D             A        
I stepped through the portal once more        
Bm            G         
And returned to the South Pole        

A               B   
But every now and then I think of them     
G               D      
My friends from the clay dimension     
A               B       
And when I feel lonely or bored       
G               D       
I play their songs on my keyboard       

(Chorus) x2
