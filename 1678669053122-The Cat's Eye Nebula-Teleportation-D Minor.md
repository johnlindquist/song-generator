# Flags of the World

Dm / Gm / A / A
Dm / Gm / A / A

Verse 1:
Dm              Gm
There are so many flags in the world
A                  Dm
Each one has a story to be told
Dm              Gm
Some are simple, some are complex
A                  Dm
Some have stars, some have crescents

Chorus:
Gm              C
But there's one flag that catches my eye
F               A
It's the flag of Comoros, oh my!
Gm              C
It has four colors and four stripes
F               A 
And a crescent moon with four stars bright

Verse 2:
Dm              Gm 
Another flag that I admire 
A               Dm 
Is the flag of Nauru, so inspired 
Dm              Gm 
It has a blue background and a yellow line 
A               Dm 
And a white star that represents their island 

Chorus:
Gm              C 
But there's one flag that catches my eye 
F               A 
It's the flag of Comoros, oh my! 
Gm              C 
It has four colors and four stripes 
F               A  
And a crescent moon with four stars bright 

Bridge:
Bb             F  
But what about Jordan, you may ask 
C              G  
He's a boy who loves astronomy and math 
Bb             F  
He dreams of traveling to outer space 
C              G  
And exploring all the wonders he can face 

Verse 3:
Dm             Gm  
He loves the Andromeda galaxy, so far away 
A              Dm  
He hopes to visit it someday 
Dm             Gm  
He loves the Great Red Spot on Jupiter, so big and red 
A              Dm  
He wonders what secrets it might hide 

Chorus:
Gm             C  
But there's one flag that catches his eye 
F              A  
It's the flag of Seychelles, oh my! 
Gm             C  
It has five colors and five rays 
F              A   
And it reminds him of his dreams every day 

Outro:
Dm / G / Am / Am (x2)
D                G   
Flags of the world, flags of the world (x4)
