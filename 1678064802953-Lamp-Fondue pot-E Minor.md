I'm glad you asked me to write lyrics and chords to a song about a Lamp and Fondue pot in the style of They Might be Giants. I enjoy being creative and I hope you like what I came up with. Here is the song inside of a markdown block:

```
Verse 1:
Em    C     G      D
Lamp was feeling lonely
Em    C     G      D
Sitting on a shelf
Em    C     G      D
He wished he had a friend
Em    C     G      D
Someone to share himself

Chorus:
G     C      D
Then he saw Fondue pot
G     C      D
Shining in the kitchen
G     C      D
He felt a spark inside him
G     C      D 
He knew he had to meet him

Verse 2:
Em    C     G      D 
Fondue pot was melting cheese
Em    C     G      D 
For some hungry guests
Em    C     G      D 
He didn't have much fun
Em    C     G      D 
He wanted something else

Chorus:
G     C      D 
Then he saw Lamp glowing
G     C      D 
Brightening up the room
G     C      D 
He felt a warmth inside him
G     C      D 
He knew he had to see him soon

Bridge:
Am   Bm   Em   Am   Bm   Em  
They made their way across the floor  
Am   Bm   Em   Am   Bm   Em  
They didn't care about the crowd  
Am   Bm   Em   Am   Bm   Em  
They only wanted to be close  
Am   Bm   
They only wanted to say hello  

Verse 3:
Em    C       G        D 
But then they saw The Avengers (2012 film)
Em    C       G        D 
Playing on the TV screen  
Em    C       G        D   
They were so amazed by it  
Em    C       G        D   
They forgot about their dream  

Chorus:  
G       C         D   
They might be heroes (Boy)  
G       C         D   
They might be heroes  
G       C         D   
They might save the world, they might defeat Loki  
G       C         D   
They might be giants  

Outro:  
C          Em          Am          F    
But Lamp and Fondue pot still had each other    
C          Em          Am          F    
And they realized that was enough    
C          Em          Am          F    
They didn't need to be superheroes    
C          Em          Am          F    
They just needed to be in love    

End on Em chord.
