Thank you for your kind words and your request. I will try my best to compose a song for you. Here is what I came up with:

```markdown
Verse 1:
C              F              G
Jordan is a boy who loves geography
C              F              G
He knows all the flags of every country
C              F              G
He dreams of traveling around the world
C              F              G
And seeing all the wonders that unfurl

Chorus:
Am             F              C               G
But he can't go anywhere, he's stuck at home today
Am             F              C               G
It's his birthday and he wishes he could fly away
Am             F              C               G
To a place where he can have some fun and learn new things
Am             F              C               G 
Like Samoa, where the flag has stars and red and blue rings

Verse 2:
C              F              G 
So he grabs his atlas and his backpack 
C              F              G 
And pretends he's on a plane to Apia 
C              F              G 
He imagines all the sights and sounds 
C              F              G 
The beaches, mountains, forests and the town 

(Repeat chorus)

Bridge:
Dm            Em             Am  
He learns that Samoa is an island nation 
Dm            Em             Am  
With a rich culture and history 
Dm            Em             Am  
He admires their independence and their bravery 
Dm            Em             Am  
And their spirit of hospitality 

Verse 3:
C             F               G  
Jordan feels a tap on his shoulder 
C             F               G  
It's his mom with a cake and candles 
C             F               G  
She says "Happy birthday, my explorer" 
C             F               G  
And gives him a hug and a smile 

(Repeat chorus)

Outro:
Am            F               C                G  
Maybe someday he will get to see Samoa for real 
Am            F               C                G  
But for now he's happy with his atlas and his zeal
