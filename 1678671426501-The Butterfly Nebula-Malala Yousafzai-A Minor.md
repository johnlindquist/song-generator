Am          F           C         G
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel
Am          F           C         G
He wanted to see every flag unfurl
Am          F           C         G
He packed his bags and took his cake pan
Am          F           C         G
He said goodbye to his pillows and ran

F          G            Am        Em
He flew across the ocean to Europe first
F          G            Am        Em
He saw San Marino's flag with its coat of arms
F          G            Am        Em
He baked a cake with their motto on it: Libertas!
F          G            Am        Em
He felt so free and happy, he wanted to dance

F          G            Am        Em 
But then he met a girl who changed his plans 
F          G            Am        Em 
She worked at CERN, where they smash particles 
F          G            Am        Em 
She showed him her flag, it was blue and yellow 
F          G            Am        Em 
She said it was for Sweden, she was so mellow 

Chorus:
Dm         E            Am        Em 
She said: Come with me, let's explore the world 
Dm         E            Am        Em 
Let's see all the flags, they're so beautiful 
Dm         E            Am        Em 
Let's make some memories, let's have some fun 
Dm         E            Am        Em  
Let's fly away together, you're my only one 

Am          F           C         G  
Jordan was smitten, he agreed right away  
Am          F           C         G  
They hopped on a plane and flew to Africa  
Am          F           C         G  
They saw Swaziland's flag with its shield and spears  
Am          F           C         G  
They learned about its history and culture

F          G            Am        Em  
They baked a cake with its colors: red, blue, yellow  
F          G            Am        Em  
They shared it with some locals who were very friendly  
F          G            Am        Em  
They felt so welcome and warm, they wanted to stay  
F          G            Am        Em   
But they had more flags to see, they were very busy  

(Chorus)

Am          F           C         G   
They flew across the Pacific to Oceania next   
Am          F           C         G   
They saw Micronesia's flag with its four stars   
Am          F           C         G   
They represented its states: Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei, Kosrae   
Am          F           C         G   
They were amazed by its beauty and diversity   

F          G            Am        Em    
They baked a cake with its shape: an oval   
F          G            Am        Em    
They decorated it with coconut flakes and fruit   
F          G            Am        Em    
They enjoyed it on the beach under the sun   
F          G            Am        Em     
But then something happened that made them glum   

(Bridge)    
C             D             Bm       A     
The girl got a call from her boss at CERN     
C             D             Bm       A     
She had to go back for an urgent matter     
C             D             Bm       A      
She told Jordan she was sorry but she had to leave     
C             D             Bm       A      
She kissed him goodbye and said she'd never forget him     

(Chorus)    

Outro:    
Dm              E               A       
Jordan was heartbroken but he understood    
Dm              E               A       
He still had his cake pan and his flags    
Dm              E               A       
He decided to keep traveling around the world    
Dm              E               A       
Maybe someday he'd find another girl    

The end. ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶
