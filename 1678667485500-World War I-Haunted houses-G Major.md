I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation.

However, since you asked me to act as a song composer, here is a song I wrote for you. It's called "Flags of the World". I hope you like it!

Verse 1:
Am   D7   G
Jordan was a curious boy
Am   D7   G
He loved to travel and explore
Am   D7   G
He had a map of all the flags
Am   D7   G
He wanted to see them all

Chorus:
G    D    C
Flags of the world, flags of the world
G    D    C
Colors, shapes, and symbols too
G    D    C
Flags of the world, flags of the world
G    D    C  G 
What do they mean to you?

Verse 2:
Am   D7   G 
One day he found a hidden door 
Am   D7   G 
Behind his closet in his room 
Am   D7   G 
He opened it and stepped inside 
Am   D7   G 
A whole new world he never knew 

Chorus:
G    D    C
Flags of the world, flags of the world
G    D    C
Colors, shapes, and symbols too
G    D    C
Flags of the world, flags of the world
G    D    C  G 
What do they mean to you?

Bridge:
Em     A     Em     A  
There he met a giant friend 
Em     A     Em     A  
Who showed him around his land 
Em     A     Em     A  
He saw a flag with red and white 
Em     A      Em      A  
And a cross that looked so grand 

Verse 3:
Am      D7       G  
That was the flag of Tonga he said 
Am      D7       G  
A kingdom in the Pacific Ocean 
Am      D7       G  
The cross stands for their Christian faith 
Am      D7       G  
And their loyalty and devotion 

Chorus:
G    D    C
Flags of the world, flags of the world
G    D    C
Colors, shapes, and symbols too
G    D    C
Flags of the world, flags of the world
