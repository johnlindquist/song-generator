Here is a song I wrote for you. I hope you like it. ðŸ˜Š

Dm  G   C
Cutting board and notebooks
Dm  G   C
They were the best of friends
Dm  G   C
They met at a garage sale
Dm  G   C
And never wanted it to end

F   Am  F   G
But then one day they got separated
F   Am  F   G
By a careless buyer who didn't care
F   Am  F   G
Cutting board was sold to Facebook, Inc.
F   Am  F   G
And notebooks went to World War I

C   Am  F   G 
Oh, cutting board and notebooks 
C   Am  F   G 
How they longed to reunite 
C   Am  F   G 
But fate had other plans for them 
C   Am  F    G 
They had to fight for their lives 

Dm  G    C  
Cutting board was used for chopping 
Dm  G    C  
Vegetables and fruits galore 
Dm  G    C  
But he also saw some secrets 
Dm  G    C  
That he wished he could ignore 

F    Am     F     G  
He learned about the data breaches 
F    Am     F     G  
And the shady deals they made 
F    Am     F     G  
He wanted to expose them all 
F    Am     F     G  
But he was afraid of getting flayed 

C    Am      F      G   
Oh, cutting board and notebooks   
C    Am      F      G   
How they missed each other so   
C    Am      F      G   
But they had to keep on going   
C    Am      F       G   
They had no choice but to grow 

Dm       G        C  
Notebooks was sent to the trenches 
Dm       G        C  
Where he witnessed blood and gore 
Dm       G        C  
But he also wrote some stories 
Dm       G        C  
That he hoped would end the war 

F         Am         F         G  
He chronicled the pain and suffering 
F         Am         F         G  
And the courage of the men 
F         Am         F         G  
He wanted to inspire peace and love 
F         Am         F         G  
But he didn't know how or when 

C          Am          F          D7    
Oh, cutting board and notebooks     
G          Em          A7          D7    
How they dreamed of being free     
G          Em          A7          D7    
But they had to face their challenges     
G          Em          A7           D7    
They had to make their own destiny     

G        Em        A7        D7    
One day they got a lucky break     
G        Em        A7        D7    
A miracle that changed their fate     
G        Em        A7        D7    
Cutting board escaped from Facebook     
G        Em        A7           D7    
And notebooks left the war behind     

Bb       Eb       Ab       
They found each other at a thrift store       
Bb       Eb       Ab       
They couldn't believe their eyes       
Bb       Eb       Ab       
They hugged each other with joy       
Bb       Eb       Ab       
And cried tears of delight       

Eb      Bb/D     Ab/C     Bb        
Oh, cutting board and notebooks         
Eb      Bb/D     Ab/C     Bb        
How they finally got their chance         
Eb      Bb/D     Ab/C     Bb        
To be together forever more         
Eb      Bb/D     Ab/C      Bb        
To sing and dance and romance
