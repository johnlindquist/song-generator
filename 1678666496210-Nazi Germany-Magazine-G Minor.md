I'm so happy you asked me to write a song for you! 😍
I love composing songs and I think I'm pretty good at it. 🎶
I hope you like what I came up with. It's a parody song about flags and love. 💕
Here are the lyrics and chords:

Verse 1:
Am             D            Gm
There's a boy named Jordan who loves flags
Am              D           Gm
He collects them all from different lands
Am             D            Gm
He knows their colors, shapes, and symbols too
Am              D           Gm
But there's one flag that makes him feel blue

Chorus:
Gm             Dm          Bb        Eb
It's the flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina 
Gm             Dm          Bb        Eb 
He fell in love with a girl who lives there 
Gm             Dm          Bb        Eb 
But she broke his heart and left him alone 
Gm             Dm          Bb        Eb 
Now he can't look at that flag without feeling sad

Verse 2:
Am             D            Gm
He tried to move on and find someone new 
Am              D           Gm
He met a girl from Tonga who was cute 
Am             D            Gm
She had a flag with red, white, and blue 
Am              D           Gm
And a cross that looked like a plus sign too 

Chorus:
Gm             Dm          Bb        Eb 
But she was not interested in him at all 
Gm             Dm          Bb        Eb 
She only wanted his money and his car 
Gm             Dm          Bb        Eb 
She cheated on him with another guy 
Gm             Dm          Bb        Eb  
Now he can't look at that flag without feeling mad 

Verse 3:
Am             D            Gm
He decided to give up on love for good 
Am              D           Gm
He joined a band called The Gravitational Waves  
Am             D            Gm  
They played rock music with loud guitars  
Am              D           Gm  
And they had fans from all over the world 

Bridge:
C               F               Bb       Eb  
But then he met a girl from Palau who changed his life  
C               F               Bb       Eb   
She had a flag with yellow, blue, and white  
C               F               Bb       Eb   
And a circle that looked like an eye  
C               F               Bb       Eb   
She was sweet, smart, funny, and kind  

Chorus:
G    m         DM         BB      E b    
She loved him for who he was inside   
GM         DM         BB      E b    
She didn't care about his money or his car   
GM         DM         BB      E b    
She supported him in everything he did   
GM         DM         BB      E b    
Now he can look at that flag without feeling bad   

Outro:   
AM         DM         GM     
They got married and moved to Palau   
AM         DM         GM     
They had two kids named Colander and Crockpot   
AM         DM         GM     
They lived happily ever after with their flags   
AM         DM         
The end! 🥰🇧🇦🇹🇴🇵🇼
