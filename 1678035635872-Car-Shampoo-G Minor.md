Here is a song I wrote for you about a Car and Shampoo in the style of They Might be Giants:

Verse 1:
Gm    D    Am    C    D    C
I bought a car from a shady dealer
Gm    D    Am    C    D    C
He said it was a bargain and a steal
Gm    D    Am    C   D   C
But when I drove it home I felt a squeal
Gm   D   Am   C  D  C
And then I saw the windshield had a peel

Chorus:
C  D  Am  Bm
Oh no, what did I do?
C  D  Am  Bm
I got a lemon car that's full of goo
C  D  Am  Bm
I need to wash it but I have no clue
C   D   Am   Bm 
How to use this shampoo

Verse 2:
Gm     D     Am     C     D     C 
I went to the store and bought some shampoo
Gm     D     Am     C     D     C 
It said it was for cars and hair too
Gm      D      Am      C      D      C 
I thought it was a joke but it was true
Gm      D      Am      C       D       C 
It had a picture of a vase and candle too

Chorus:
C  D  Am  Bm 
Oh no, what did I do?
C  D  Am  Bm 
I got a weird shampoo that's two in one
C   D   Am   Bm 
I don't know how to use it or have fun
C   D   Am   Bm 
With this shampoo

Bridge:
Em        F         G         A  
Maybe I should try to wash my hair
Em        F         G         A  
With this shampoo that's so rare
Em        F         G         A  
Maybe it will make my hair shine bright
Em        F         G         A  
Or maybe it will turn my hair white

Verse 3:
Gm       D       Am       C       D       C 
I tried to wash my hair with the shampoo
Gm       D       Am       C       D       C 
But something strange happened out of the blue
Gm        D        Am        C        D        C 
My hair started to grow and curl like crazy too   
Gm          E          F          G          E          F          
And then I realized the shampoo was made of glue

Chorus:
F G Em A  
Oh no, what did I do?
F G Em A  
I got a sticky hair that's hard to comb   
F G Em A  
I need to cut it but I have no scissors   
F G Em A  
Or this shampoo  

Outro:   
F G Em A (repeat until fade)   
Shampoo, shampoo, oh what did I do?   
Shampoo, shampoo, oh what did I do?
