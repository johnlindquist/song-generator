Sure thing, boss! I love composing songs and I'm amazing at it! üòç
Here's a song I wrote for you about the flags of the world. It's a parody of "We Are The World" by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie. I hope you like it!

```
Bm7   E7   Am
There comes a time
When we need to see some flags
Am/G  F    G    C
The colors and shapes that make us proud
C/B  Am   Am/G  F
Some have stars and stripes or crosses too
F/E Dm7  E7   Am
Some have lions, dragons or kangaroos

Bm7   E7   Am
There are people dying from ignorance
Am/G  F    G    C
They don't know their flags or what they mean
C/B  Am   Am/G  F
So let's show them all the beauty of diversity 
F/E Dm7  E7   Am 
And teach them how to sing in harmony

A     E     D     A 
We are the flags, we are the nations 
A     E     D     A 
We are the ones who make a brighter day so let's start waving 
A     E     D     A 
There's a choice we're making, we're saving our own pride 
A      Bm    C#m    D    A/C# Bm E A  
It's true we'll make a better world just with our flags 

Bm7   E7   Am  
Did you know that Vatican City has a key?
Am/G  F    G    C  
It symbolizes the power of Saint Peter 
C/B  Am   Am/G  F  
And Moldova has an eagle holding an olive branch 
F/E Dm7  E7   Am  
It represents peace and sovereignty 

Bm7   E7   Am  
And what about Sao Tome and Principe? 
Am/G  F    G    C  
Their flag has two stars on a red triangle 
C/B  Am   Am/G  F  
They stand for hope and independence for their people 
F/E Dm7  E7   Am  
Who fought against colonialism with courage 

A     E     D     A  
We are the flags, we are the nations 
A     E     D     A  
We are the ones who make a brighter day so let's start waving 
A     E     D     A  
There's a choice we're making, we're saving our own pride 
A      Bm    C#m    D    A/C# Bm E A   
It's true we'll make a better world just with our flags 

Bm7   E7   Am   
Now there's a boy named Jordan who loves astronomy 
Am/G  F    G    C   
He dreams of visiting The Andromeda Observatory 
C/B  Am   Am/G  F   
But he lives in a country where they don't have one yet 
F/E Dm7  E7   Am   
So he looks at his flag and feels inspired by it 

Bm7   E7   Am   
His flag has four colors: red, white, black and green 
Am/G  F    G    C   
They represent blood, peace, strength and hope respectively 
C/B  Am   Am/G  F   
And in the center there's a seven-pointed star that shines bright    
F/E Dm7  E7       Em    
It symbolizes faith and unity among his people

Em/D C G/B Em/D C G/B Em/D C G/B Em/D C G/B Em/D C G/B Em/D C G/B Em/D C G/B Em/D

Em       B         Em       B     
Jordan is not alone in his passion for space     
Em       B         Em       B     
He has friends from different countries who share his taste     
Em       B         Em       B     
They met online through The Andromeda Observatory website     
Em       B         Em       B     
And they decided to form a band called The Starlighters     

G      D      C      G      
They sing about their flags and how they relate to space      
G      D      C      G      
They use metaphors like cake pans, loch ness monsters and lace      
G      D      C      G      
They want to spread their message of love and curiosity      
G      A      B        C        G/F# Em D/F# G       
They believe that music can connect people across galaxies      

G        D/F
