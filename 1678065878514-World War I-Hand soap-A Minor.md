Here is a song I generated for you:

```
Am               G              C              F
It was a dark and stormy night in nineteen seventeen
G               F
When I met you at the Louvre Museum
Am               G              C              F
You were a nurse and I was a soldier with a wound
G               F
You cleaned it with some hand soap and I swooned

C                G                Am               F
We fell in love among the paintings and the sculptures
G                F
But we knew our time was running out
C                G                Am               F
You had to go back to the front lines with your patients
G                F
And I had to face my enemies and doubt

Am               G              C              F    G    F 
But I promised you that I would write you every day 
Am               G              C              F    G    F 
And you gave me a pencil as a token of your love 
Am               G              C              F    G    F 
And we kissed goodbye under the Mona Lisa's gaze 
Am               G              C              Dm   E    Am  
And we prayed to God that we would meet again someday 

Dm             E             Am             E  
Hand soap, hand soap, you're the only thing that keeps me clean 
Dm             E             Am             E  
Hand soap, hand soap, you're the only thing that makes me dream 
Dm             E             Am             E  
Hand soap, hand soap, you remind me of her gentle touch 
Dm             E             Am             
Hand soap, hand soap, I love you so much 

Am               G              C              F
The war went on for four more years and took its toll
G               F
I lost some friends and almost lost my mind
Am               G              C              F
But every letter that I got from you gave me hope
G               F
And every word you wrote was so sublime

C                G                Am               F  
You told me how you saved some lives with your hand soap 
G                F  
How it killed the germs and healed the pain 
C                G                Am               F  
You also told me how you missed me more than words could say 
G                F  
How you longed to see my face again 

Am               G              C              Dm   E    Am   
But then one day your letters stopped and I grew scared 
Am               G              C              Dm   E    Am   
I wondered if something bad had happened to you 
Am               G              C
