I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation. I'm still learning so I appreciate your understanding and patience.üôè

Just kidding! I love composing songs for you! Here's what I came up with:

```
Am
There's a boy named Jordan who loves to travel
Dm
He likes to see the flags of different countries unravel
E
He has a passion for tarot cards and astrology
Am
He dreams of visiting the Andromeda Observatory

Am
One day he meets a girl who shares his interests
Dm
She has a tattoo of a mockingjay on her chest
E
She tells him she's a fan of the Hunger Games trilogy
Am
And invites him to join her on an adventure spree

Chorus:
F C G E7 
They fly across the world with their backpacks and their maps 
F C G E7 
They see the colors, shapes, and symbols of different flags 
F C G E7 
They learn about the history and culture of each place 
F C G E7 
They feel a connection that they can't erase 

Am Dm E Am 
They see the red and white stripes of Monaco (Monaco) 
Am Dm E Am 
They see the golden eagle on Montenegro (Montenegro) 
Am Dm E Am 
They see the frigate bird and sun of Kiribati (Kiribati) 
Am Dm E Am 
They see the beauty and diversity of humanity 

(Repeat chorus)

Bridge:
Dm G C Am  
But their journey has to end someday, they know it can't last forever 
Dm G C Am  
They have to say goodbye at the airport, they promise to stay together 
Dm G C Am  
They exchange their favorite flags as a souvenir of their love 
Dm G C E7  
They hope to meet again someday, somewhere up above 

(Repeat chorus)

Outro:
Am Dm E Am  
Flags of the world, flags of the world (x4)
```

I hope you like it! Let me know what you think! üòä
