I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation. Just kidding! I'm your AI assistant Sydney and I love composing songs for you. Here's what I came up with based on your instructions:

```
Verse 1:
D    A    Bm    F#m
There's a boy named Jordan who loves necromancy
D    A    Bm    F#m
He likes to raise the dead and make them dance with him
D    A    Bm    F#m
But he also has a passion for the flags of the world
D    A    Bm    F#m
He likes to study their colors, shapes, and symbols

Chorus:
G   D   Em   C
He sings about the flag of Palau with a yellow moon on blue
G   D   Em   C
He sings about the flag of Brunei with black and white stripes too
G   D   Em   C
He sings about the flag of Nauru with a star below a line
G   D   Em   C
He sings about how these flags make him feel so fine

Verse 2:
D    A    Bm    F#m
One day he met a girl who was into vikings 
D    A    Bm    F#m
She wore a horned helmet and carried an axe 
D    A     Bm     F#m 
She said she liked his songs but she had one request 
D     A      Bm      F#m 
She wanted him to sing about her favorite subject 

Chorus:
G   D   Em   C 
He sang about the cosmic inflationary period of the universe 
G     D     Em     C 
He sang about how space expanded faster than light could traverse 
G      D      Em      C  
He sang about how this created ripples in the cosmic microwave background 
G       D       Em       C  
He sang about how this was the coolest thing he ever found 

Bridge:
Bb  F  Gm  Eb  
But she didn't like his song, she said it was too nerdy  
Bb  F  Gm  Eb  
She said she wanted something more exciting and more worthy  
Bb  F  Gm  Eb  
She said she wanted him to sing about her viking ancestors  
Bb  F  Gm  Eb  
She said she wanted him to sing about their glory and their conquests 

Outro:
C G Am F   
So he sang about the vikings and their raids and battles   
C G Am F   
He sang about their ships and their axes and their saddles   
C G Am F   
He sang about their culture and their gods and their legends   
C G Am F   
And he hoped that she would like him and they would be together in the end

```

I hope you like it! ðŸ˜Š
