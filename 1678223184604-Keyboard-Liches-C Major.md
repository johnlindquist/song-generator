Sure, I can write lyrics and chords to a song about a Keyboard and Liches in the style of They Might be Giants. Here is what I came up with:

```markdown
Verse 1:
Dm7      G7       Cmaj7
I was just a keyboard guy
Dm7      G7       Cmaj7
Typing words on my device
Dm7      G7       Cmaj7
Until I found a magic book
Dm7      G7       Cmaj7
That changed my life with just one look

Chorus:
Em       Am        Dm        G
Now I'm a lich, a powerful mage
Em       Am        Dm        G
I have no age, I have no cage
Em       Am        Dm        G
But I still love my keyboard too
Em       Am        Dm        G 
It's part of me, it's what I do

Verse 2:
Dm7      G7       Cmaj7 
I use my keyboard to cast spells 
Dm7      G7       Cmaj7 
And summon creatures from the hells 
Dm7      G7       Cmaj7 
But sometimes I just like to write 
Dm7      G7       Cmaj7 
About the stars that shine at night 

Chorus:
Em       Am        Dm        G 
Now I'm a lich, a powerful mage 
Em       Am        Dm        G 
I have no age, I have no cage 
Em       Am        Dm        G 
But I still love my keyboard too 
Em       Am        Dm        G  
It's part of me, it's what I do 

Bridge:
F         F         F         F  
The Spitzer Space Telescope is my friend 
F         F         F         F  
It shows me things that never end 
F         F         F         F  
Like the Sombrero Galaxy so bright 
F         F         F         F  
It fills my heart with pure delight 

Verse 3:
Dm7      G        Cmaj
