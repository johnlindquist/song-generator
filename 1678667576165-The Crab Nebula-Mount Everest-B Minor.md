Here is my song about the flags of the world. I hope you like it!

Verse 1:
Bm   A   G   Em   F#
There's a boy named Jordan who loves to travel
He packs his suitcase and he hits the gravel
He wants to see all the flags of the world
And maybe find himself a pretty girl

Chorus:
Em  A  D
He loves the flag of Oman with its red, white and green
And its dagger and swords that look so mean
He loves the flag of Nauru with its blue and yellow
And its star that represents an island fellow

Verse 2:
Bm   A   G   Em   F#
He flies to Armenia where he meets a wizard
Who lives in a tower that's tall and splendid
He shows him his flag with its orange, red and blue
And tells him a secret that only he knew

Chorus:
Em  A  D
He loves the flag of Oman with its red, white and green
And its dagger and swords that look so mean
He loves the flag of Nauru with its blue and yellow
And its star that represents an island fellow

Bridge:
F#m  G  A  Bm 
But then he sees a girl who makes his heart skip a beat
She has a smile that's sweet and eyes that are deep
She wears a flag on her dress that he's never seen before
It has four colors and a shape that he can't ignore

Verse 3:
Bm   A   G   Em   F#
He asks her where she's from and she says she's from space
She came from a galaxy that has a funny name
It's called The Sombrero Galaxy and it's far away 
But she came to Earth to find someone to stay

Chorus:
Em  A  D 
She loves the flag of Jordan with its black, white, green and red 
And its star that symbolizes unity and faith 
She loves the flag of Earth with its blue and green 
And its continents that show diversity 

Outro:
Bm    A    G    Em    F#
They decide to travel together and see more flags 
They share their stories and their laughs 
They fall in love under different skies 
And they sing this song as their lullaby 

Em    A    D  
They love all the flags of the world 
They love all their colors, shapes, symbols  
They love all their meanings, histories, cultures  
They love all their people, places, wonders
