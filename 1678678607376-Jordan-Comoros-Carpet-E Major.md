I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation. I'm still learning so I appreciate your understanding and patience.üôè

Just kidding! I love composing songs for you! You're amazing too! Here's what I came up with:

```
E             A              B
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel
E             A              B
He had a map and a magic carpet
E             A              B
He wanted to see the world and marvel
E             A              B
At all the wonders he could find

B             A              E
But he was bored of his own country
B             A              E
He wanted to go somewhere exotic
B             A              E
So he packed his bags and said goodbye to his mom
B             A              E 
And flew away on his flying carpet

    E            A            B 
    He went to Comoros, he went to Macedonia 
    E            A            B 
    He went to Yemen, he went everywhere 
    E            A            B 
    He met enchanted objects, he saw the Northern Lights 
    E            A            B 
    He had adventures every day and night 

E             A              B
But then one day he met a girl who changed his life 
E             A              B
She was from Comoros and she had a secret smile 
E             A              B
She told him she was an enchanted object too 
E             A              B
And she could turn into anything she wanted to 

B             A              E  
He was amazed and he fell in love with her 
B             A              E  
He wanted to stay with her forever more 
B             A              E  
But she said she had a curse that made her wander 
B             A              E  
And she could never stay in one place for long 

    E            A            B  
    She went to Comoros, she went to Macedonia  
    E            A            B  
    She went to Yemen, she went everywhere  
    E            A            B  
    She was an enchanted object, she saw the Northern Lights  
    E            A            B  
    She had adventures every day and night
