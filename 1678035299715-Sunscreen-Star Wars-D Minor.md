I'm glad you asked me to write a song about Sunscreen and Star Wars in the style of They Might be Giants. I enjoy their quirky and catchy songs, such as "Whistling In The Dark", "I Palindrome I" and "Particle Man" [^1^]. Here is my attempt at creating a parody song with your specifications. I hope you like it!

```
Dm  Am  Gm  A
Sunscreen and Star Wars
Dm  Am  Gm  A
They might seem like opposites
Dm  Am  Gm  A
But they have more in common than you think
Dm  Am  Gm  A
Let me tell you a story about them

F   C   G   C
Sunscreen protects you from the sun's rays
F   C   G   C
Star Wars is a saga of heroes and villains
F   C   G   C
But what if they were both part of the same plot?
F   C   G   C
What if they were both part of a sunscreen conspiracy?

Dm      Am      Gm      A
Luke Skywalker was a farm boy on Tatooine 
Dm      Am      Gm      A 
He dreamed of joining the Rebel Alliance 
Dm      Am      Gm      A 
But he had to stay home and apply sunscreen 
Dm      Am      Gm      A 
Because his uncle said it was good for his skin 

F       C       G       C 
But little did he know that sunscreen was a trap 
F       C       G       C 
It was made by the Empire to control his mind 
F       C       G       C 
It contained a secret ingredient called midichlorian sap 
F       C       G       C 
That would make him obey Darth Vader's commands 

Sunscreen and Star Wars (Boy)  
They might be giants  
They might be good, they might be evil  
They might be part of a galactic scheme  

Sunscreen and Star Wars  
They might be giants  
They might be allies, they might be foes  
They might be more than what they seem  

Princess Leia was a leader of the Rebellion  
She fought against the tyranny of the Emperor  
But she also had a secret obsession  
She loved to use sunscreen every day  

But little did she know that sunscreen was a trap  
It was made by the Empire to control her mind  
It contained a secret ingredient called midichlorian sap  
That would make her fall in love with Darth Vader's son  

Sunscreen and Star Wars (Boy)  
They might be giants  
They might be good, they might be evil  
They might be part of a galactic scheme  

Sunscreen and Star Wars  
They might be giants  
They might be allies, they might be foes   
They might be more than what they seem  

Han Solo was a smuggler and a scoundrel   
He flew across the galaxy in his ship, the Millennium Falcon   
He didn't care about sunscreen or Star Wars   
He only cared about money and himself   

But little did he know that sunscreen was a trap   
It was made by the Empire to control his mind   
It contained a secret ingredient called midichlorian sap   
That would make him betray his friends for gold   

Sunscreen and Star Wars (Boy)   
They might be giants   
They might be good, they might be evil   
They might be part of a galactic scheme   

Sunscreen and Star Wars   
They might be giants   
They might be allies, they might be foes    
They might be more than what they seem   

Yoda was a wise and powerful Jedi master    
He taught Luke how to use the Force for good    
He warned him about sunscreen and its danger    
He said it was the path to the dark side    

But little did he know that sunscreen was not all bad    
It also had some benefits for those who used it well    
It could enhance their skills and make them stronger than ever    
It could even help them defeat Darth Vader himself    

Sunscreen and Star Wars (Boy)     
They Might Be Giants     
The choice is yours     
You can use them for good or evil     
You can join them or fight them     

Sunscreen and Star Wars     
The Might Be Giants     
The end is near     
You can save or destroy the galaxy     
You can make your own destiny     

[Outro]      
Hang on...hang on tight...
