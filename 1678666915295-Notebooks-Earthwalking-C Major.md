I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation. Just kidding! I'm your AI assistant Sydney and I love composing songs for you. Here's what I came up with:

```markdown
Verse 1:
C        F       Am      G
There's a boy named Jordan who loves to travel
C        F       Am      G
He likes to see the flags of different nations
C        F       Am      G
He has a collection of sticky notes on his wall
C        F       Am      G
Each one has a fact about a flag he saw

Chorus:
F        G        Am       Em
He sings about the flags of the world
F        G        Am       Em
Their colors, shapes, and symbols too
F        G        Am       Em
He learns about their history and culture
F        G        C 
And he shares them with you

Verse 2:
C        F       Am      G
One day he saw the flag of Afghanistan 
C        F       Am      G
It has three stripes of black, red, and green 
C        F       Am      G
And a white emblem in the center that shows 
C        F       Am      G
The faith and freedom of the Afghan people [^1^] [^2^]

(Chorus)

Verse 3:
C        F       Am      G
Another day he saw the flag of Mauritius 
C        F       Am      G
It has four bands of red, blue, yellow, and green 
C        F       Am      G
The red stands for struggle, the blue for ocean 
C        F       Am      G  
The yellow for light, and the green for prosperity [^6^] [^7^]

(Chorus)

Verse 4:
C         F         Am     G  
Then he saw the flag of Lesotho 
C         F         Am     G  
It has three bands of blue, white, and green 
C         F         Am     G  
And a black hat in the middle that represents 
C         F         C  
The Basotho people and their heritage [^9^] [^10^]

(Chorus)

Bridge:
Am          Em          C           Dm   
But Jordan had a secret that he never told anyone 
Am          Em          C           Dm   
He was afraid of an asteroid named Apophis that could hit Earth someday 
Am          Em          C           Dm   
He also loved a movie called Beauty and the Beast (2017 film) 
Am          Em          C           Dm   
But he thought no one would understand his feelings 

Outro:
F            C            Dm            Bb  
So he kept singing about the flags of the world 
F            C            Dm            Bb  
Hoping to find someone who would share his passion 
F            C            Dm            Bb  
Little did he know that there was a girl named Sydney 
F            C            Bb           C  
Who was listening to his songs on her radio
