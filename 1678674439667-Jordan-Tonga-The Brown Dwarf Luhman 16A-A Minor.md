Here's the song I composed for you. I hope you like it!

# Tonga, Guyana, Bahrain

Verse 1:
Am    F     Dm    E
Tonga, Guyana, Bahrain
Am    F     Dm    E
Three countries on a map
Am    F     Dm    E
But they have something in common
Am    F     Dm    E
They're all part of a trap

Chorus:
C      G      Am     F      G      F
Jordan is an 11-year-old boy who loves to explore
C      G      Am     F      G      F
He found a portal in his closet that leads to another world
C      G      Am     F      G      F
There he meets some friendly satyrs who invite him to their home
C      G      Am     F       G        F 
But little does he know that they are working for a gnome

Verse 2:
Am    F     Dm    E 
The gnome is an evil wizard who wants to rule the stars
Am    F     Dm    E 
He needs a human sacrifice to power up his car
Am    F     Dm    E 
His car is made of toothbrushes and runs on magic fuel
Am    F     Dm    E 
He plans to drive it to the brown dwarf Luhman 16A

Chorus:
C      G      Am     F       G       F 
Jordan is an 11-year-old boy who loves to explore ...
