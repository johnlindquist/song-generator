Here is a song I wrote about Human rights and Selena Gomez in the style of They Might be Giants:

Gm Eb Bb F
Selena Gomez was a pop star sensation
Gm Eb Bb F
She had millions of fans across every nation
Gm Eb Bb F
But she felt something was missing in her life
Gm Eb Bb F
She wanted to make a difference and end all the strife

Cm D Gm Eb D Eb
So she joined a human rights organization
Cm D Gm Eb D Eb
And she traveled around the world on a mission
Cm D Gm Eb D Eb
She met people who were suffering from injustice and oppression
Cm D Gm Eb D Cm 
And she vowed to use her voice to raise awareness and compassion

G C Em D C D 
She sang for human rights, she sang for freedom 
G C Em D C D 
She sang for dignity, she sang for everyone 
G C Em D C D 
She sang for human rights, she sang with passion 
G C Em D C G 
She sang for Selena, she sang for love 

Gm Eb Bb F 
One day she got an invitation from NASA 
Gm Eb Bb F 
They wanted her to sing on the moon for Apollo 11's anniversary basha  
Gm Eb Bb F  
She was thrilled and honored by this opportunity  
Gm Eb Bb F  
She packed her bags and boarded the rocket eagerly 

Cm D Gm Eb D Eb  
But something went wrong during the launch sequence  
Cm D Gm Eb D Eb  
The rocket malfunctioned and exploded into pieces  
Cm D Gm Eb D Eb  
Selena was ejected into space with no hope of rescue  
Cm D Gm Eb D C
