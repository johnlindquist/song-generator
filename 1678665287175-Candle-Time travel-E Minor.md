Em   C    G    D
There's a boy named Jordan who loves to travel
Em   C    G    D
He wants to see every flag that he can unravel
Em   C    G    D
He likes their colors, shapes, and symbols too
Em   C    G    D
He thinks they tell a story that is true

Em   Am   Bm   C
But he has a problem that he can't ignore
Em   Am   Bm   C
He's in love with Rocky but he's not sure if she feels more
Em   Am   Bm   C
She likes to watch him box but she doesn't like his scars
Em   Am   Bm   C 
She thinks he's brave but she doesn't know his heart

G     D     Em     C 
So he takes her on a trip around the world 
G     D     Em     C 
To show her all the flags that make him swirl 
G     D     Em     C 
He hopes she'll see him in a different light 
G     D     Em     C 
And maybe they'll fall in love tonight 

Em  C  G  D  
They start with Comoros where they see four stars 
Em  C  G  D  
They represent Islam, Africa, France, and Arabs 
Em  C  G  D  
The green is for hope, white is for peace 
Em  C  G  D  
The red is for bloodshed, yellow is for sunshine 

Chorus

Em  C  G  D  
Then they go to Laos where they see three bands 
Em  C  G  D  
The red is for blood of those who fought for their land 
Em  C  G  D  
The blue is for prosperity, unity, and justice 
Em  C  G  D  
The white circle is for the moon over Mekong River 

Chorus

Bridge:
C      Am      Em      Bm   
But along their journey they encounter some trouble 
C      Am      Em      Bm   
They get caught in a volcano that makes them bubble 
C      Am      Em      Bm   
They're trapped in the Ring of Fire that burns so hot 
C      Am      Em      Bm   
They wonder if they'll ever get out or not 

Solo: (same chords as verse)

Chorus

Outro:
Em       C       G       D     
But then they see a miracle that saves their lives 
Em       C       G       D     
A flag from Swaziland that flies so high 
Em       C       G       D     
It has red for past battles, blue for peace and stability 
Em       C       G       D     
Yellow for resources, black and white for diversity 

Final chorus:
G        D        Em        C        
And then they realize that they have something in common too    
G        D        Em        C        
They both love flags and each other too    
G        D        Em        C        
They kiss under Saturn's rings that shine so bright    
G        D        Em        (let ring)       
And finally they fall in love tonight
