Okay, I will try my best to write a song parody about a trash can and the Sasquatch in the style of They Might Be Giants. Here is what I came up with:

# Trash Can And The Sasquatch

Verse 1:
A              F#m
There's a trash can in the woods
D              E
It's full of secrets and some goods
A              F#m
It doesn't know why it is there
D              E
But it doesn't really care

Chorus:
D             E             F#m            C#
It might be lonely, it might be sad
D             E             F#m            C#
But it has a friend that makes it glad
D             E             F#m            C#
He's big and hairy, he's hard to see
D             E             A 
He's the Sasquatch and he loves the trash can

Verse 2:
A              F#m
The Sasquatch lives in isolation
D              E 
He avoids the human population
A              F#m 
He likes to roam around the trees
D              E 
And eat whatever he can seize

Chorus:
D             E             F#m            C#
He might be hungry, he might be mad
D             E             F#m            C#
But he has a friend that makes him glad
D             E             F#m            C#
He's small and metal, he's easy to see
D             E             A 
He's the trash can and he loves the Sasquatch

Bridge:
Bm           G           D           A 
They don't need anyone else in their lives
Bm           G           D           A 
They have each other and they survive

Verse 3:
A              F#m 
One day a hunter came along
D              E 
He saw the trash can and thought it was wrong
A              F#m 
He tried to take it away from its place
D              E 
But then he saw a furry face

Chorus:
D             E             F#m            C#
He was so scared, he was so bad  
D             E             F#m            C#
But he had no friends that made him glad  
D             E             F#m            C#
He ran away screaming, he never came back  
D             E             
The trash can and the Sasquatch  
F#m          C#
They hugged each other  
F#m          A   
They were so happy  

Outro:  
A   F#   D   B   
The end!
