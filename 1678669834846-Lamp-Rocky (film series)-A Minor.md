# Flags of the World

Verse 1:
Am   Dm   Bm   E
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel
He wanted to see every flag unfurl
He packed his bags and took his yoga mat
He hoped to find some peace in this world

Chorus:
C    F    G    C
But he didn't know what he would find
As he crossed the borders of each land
He discovered secrets and surprises
That he could never understand

Verse 2:
Am   Dm   Bm   E
He went to Guyana and saw their flag
It had green, yellow, red, and white
He met a girl who said she could shapechange
She turned into a bird and took flight

Chorus:
C    F    G    C
But he didn't know what he would find
As he crossed the borders of each land
He discovered secrets and surprises
That he could never understand

Verse 3:
Am   Dm   Bm   E 
He went to Georgia and saw their flag 
It had red crosses on a white field 
He met a man who said he knew Nessie 
The Loch Ness Monster was his friend for real 

Chorus: 
C    F    G    C 
But he didn't know what he would find 
As he crossed the borders of each land 
He discovered secrets and surprises 
That he could never understand 

Verse 4: 
Am   Dm   Bm   E 
He went to Afghanistan and saw their flag 
It had black, red, and green stripes 
He met a monk who said he taught yoga 
He showed him how to breathe and meditate right 

Chorus: 
C    F    G    C 
But he didn't know what he would find 
As he crossed the borders of each land 
He discovered secrets and surprises 
That he could never understand 

Outro:  
Am   Dm   Bm   E  
Jordan learned a lot from his journey  
He saw the beauty of diversity  
He realized that flags are more than colors  
They represent stories and history
