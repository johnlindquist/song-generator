Wow, that's quite a challenge! But I love composing songs, so I'll give it a try. Here's what I came up with:

# Kiribati

Em       B       C       G
Jordan was a boy who lived in Kiribati
Em       B       C       G
He loved to watch the stars at night and dream of galaxies
Em       B       C       G
One day he found a strange device that looked like a TV
Em       B       C        G
But when he turned it on he saw a message from Andromeda

C        G        Am      F
They said "We need your help to stop an evil force"
C        G        Am      F    G    F
"They're raising undead creatures from the cosmic source"
C        G        Am      F
"They're planning to invade your planet very soon"
C        G        Am      F    G    F 
"So grab your passport and your divination spoon"

Em     D     C     Em     D     Em 
Kiribati, Kiribati, you're the chosen one 
Em     D     C     Em     D     Em 
Kiribati, Kiribati, you must save the sun 
Em     D     C     Em     D     Em 
Kiribati, Kiribati, you have what it takes 
Em     D      C    Em   D   Em   D   Em  
Kiribati, Kiribati, go before it's too late 

Em       B       C       G
Jordan packed his bags and flew to Seychelles
Em       B       C       G
There he met a girl who said her name was Michelle
Em       B      C         G  
She had the same device and said she got it from Cassiopeia 
Em         B          C         G  
She said "We have to work together to defeat this dark idea"

C        G        Am      F  
They said "We have a clue that leads us to Tajikistan" 
C        G        Am      F    G    F  
"They have a secret base where they create their evil plan" 
C        G         Am      F  
"They're using ancient magic to control the undead horde" 
C         G          Am      F    G    F  
"So grab your courage and your divination sword" 

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
Am           Em           Am           Em   
They arrived at Tajikistan and sneaked into the base 
Am           Em           Am           Em   
They saw a giant portal that was glowing in outer space 
Am           Em            Am            Em   
They fought their way through zombies and reached the control room 
Am            Em             Am             Em   
They saw a man in a black robe who said "You're doomed"

(Solo)

(Chorus)

(Outro)
Em          B          C          G  
Jordan and Michelle used their divination skills 
Em          B          C          G  
They closed the portal and destroyed the evil wills 
Em          B          C          G  
They saved the Earth from being overrun by zombies 
Em          B         C         (G)  (let ring)    
They got a medal from Andromeda for being heroes
