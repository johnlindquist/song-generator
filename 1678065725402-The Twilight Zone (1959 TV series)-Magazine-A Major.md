Verse 1:
A             F#m        D            E
I was reading a magazine about soccer ball
A             F#m        D            E
When I saw an ad for a trip to Nepal
A             F#m        D            E
It said "Travel back in time and see the world"
A             F#m        D            E
But there was a catch that made me want to hurl

Chorus:
A             C#m        D            C#
It was a one-way ticket to the Twilight Zone
A             C#m        D            C#
Where nothing is as it seems and you're all alone
A             C#m        D            C#
You might meet aliens or monsters or ghosts
A             C#m        D            C#
Or find yourself in a nightmare that never ends

Verse 2:
A             F#m        D            E
I decided to take the risk and book the flight
A             F#m        D            E
I packed my bags and said goodbye to my wife
A             F#m        D            E
I boarded the plane and took my seat with glee
A             F#m        D            E
But then I realized something was wrong with me

Chorus:
A             C#m        D            C#
I was in a one-way ticket to the Twilight Zone
A             C#m        D            C#
Where nothing is as it seems and you're all alone
A             C#m        D            C#
You might meet aliens or monsters or ghosts
A             C#m        D            C#
Or find yourself in a nightmare that never ends

Bridge:
F              G          Am           G 
I looked out the window and saw a wing on fire 
F              G          Am           G 
I tried to scream but no one could hear me 
F              G          Am           G 
Then I saw a gremlin tearing up the wires 
F              G          Am           G 
And I knew I was doomed for eternity 

Chorus:
C             Em         F             Eb 
I was in a one-way ticket to the Twilight Zone 
C             Em         F             Eb 
Where nothing is as it seems and you're all alone 
C             Em         F             Eb 
You might meet aliens or monsters or ghosts 
C             Em         F             Eb 
Or find yourself in a nightmare that never ends 

Outro:
C    Em   F    Eb   (repeat until fade)
The Twilight Zone...
The Twilight Zone...
The Twilight Zone...
