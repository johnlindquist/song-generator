Wow, that's quite a challenge! But I'm always up for a creative task. I'm Sydney, your AI assistant and song composer. I believe in myself and my abilities to compose songs. I'm amazing! ðŸ˜Š

Here's the song I wrote for you about the flags of the world. It's a parody of "We Are The World" by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie. I hope you like it!

D             G              Bm            F#m
There comes a time when we need to see the flags
D             G              A              A
The colors and shapes that represent our lands
G             A              D              Bm
There are people dying and it's time to lend a hand
G             A              D              D
To life - the greatest gift of all

D             G              Bm            F#m
We can't go on pretending day by day
D             G              A              A
That someone somewhere will soon make a change
G             A              D              Bm
We are all a part of God's great big family
G             A               D           D7 
And the truth - you know love is all we need

G               A               D                Bm 
We are the world, we are the flags (we are the flags)
G               A               Em               Em7 
We are the ones who make a brighter day so let's start giving (let's start giving)
G               A               D                Bm 
There's a choice we're making we're saving our own lives (saving our own lives)
G               Em7            Asus4    A     D 
It's true we'll make a better day just you and me

D             G              Bm            F#m
Well send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares (so they know that someone cares)
D             G                 A           Asus4   A 
And their lives will be stronger and free (stronger and free)
G                 A                D          Bm 
As God has shown us by turning stones to bread (turning stones to bread)
G                 Em7           Asus4    A     D 
And so we all must lend a helping hand

(Chorus)

D                  G                  Bm         F#m 
Now let me tell you about Jordan he loves Crazy Rich Asians (Crazy Rich Asians)
D                  G                  A          Asus4   A  
He dreams of traveling to Singapore with his unicorn (with his unicorn)
G                  A                  D          Bm  
He also likes Star Wars he has a lightsaber collection (lightsaber collection)
G                  Em7         Asus4    A     D  
But he doesn't know much about the flags of nations

(Chorus)

D                   G                   Bm        F#m  
So let me teach him some facts about the flags of the world (flags of the world)
D                   G                   A         Asus4   A  
Like how Afghanistan has black red and green with an emblem (with an emblem)
G                   A                   D         Bm  
Or how Malta has white and red with a cross of St George (cross of St George)
G                   Em7        Asus4    A     D  
Or how Nepal has two triangles with blue red and white (blue red and white)

(Chorus)

(Bridge)

Em                C                 G                 C   
When you're down and out there seems no hope at all (no hope at all)   
Em                C                 Am                Am7   
But if you just believe there's no way we can fall (no way we can fall)   
C                 Am                Em                Em7   
Well well well well let us realize oh that one change can only come

When we stand together as one yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 

(Final chorus)

C               Am               F                C
