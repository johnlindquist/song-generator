Sure, I can try to write a song about a backpack and Jaws in the style of They Might Be Giants. Here is what I came up with:

```markdown
Dm    Gm    A    F
I was walking on the Brooklyn Bridge one day
Dm    Gm    A    F
With my backpack full of books and rice cooker
Dm    Gm    A    F
When I saw a giant shark fin in the bay
Dm    Gm    A   F
It was Jaws, he came back for another looker

Gm     C     Dm
He might be Jaws (Boy)
Gm     C     Dm
He might be Jaws 
Gm     C     Dm 
He might be hungry, he might be mean 
Gm      C      Dm 
He might be coming for my rice and beans 

Dm   Gm   A   F 
I ran away as fast as I could go 
Dm   Gm   A   F 
But he followed me onto the bridge somehow 
Dm   Gm   A   F 
He was snapping at my heels and at my toes 
Dm   Gm  A  F  
He was Jaws, he wanted to eat me now 

Gm     C     Dm  
He might be Jaws (Boy) 
Gm     C     DM  
He might be Jaws  
GM      C      DM  
He might be angry, he might be bored  
GM      C      DM  
He might be looking for a new reward  

DM  GM  AM  FM  
I threw my backpack at his open mouth   
DM  GM  AM  FM   
And hoped that he would choke on all my stuff   
DM  GM  AM  FM   
But he just swallowed it without a doubt   
DM  GM AM FM    
He was Jaws, he couldn't get enough   

GM      C       DM   
He might be Jaws (Boy)   
GM      C       DM   
He might be Jaws    
GM       C       DM    
He might be smart, he might have a plan    
GM       C       DM    
He might be waiting for another man    

DM GM AM FM     
I jumped off the bridge into a boat     
DM GM AM FM     
And sailed away as fast as I could steer     
DM GM AM FM     
But he followed me with every single stroke     
DM GM AM FM      
It was Jaws, he wouldn't disappear     

GM        C        DM      
He is definitely Jaws (Boy)      
GM        C        DM      
He is definitely Jaws       
GM         C         DM       
He is definitely after me       
GM         C         DM       
He is definitely history       

[End]
