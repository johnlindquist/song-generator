# The Milky Way Games

Verse 1:
A             F#m
In a galaxy far away
D              E
There's a place where people play
A             F#m
A deadly game of life and death
D              E
Where only one can catch their breath

Chorus:
A             D              E             D
It's the Milky Way Games, it's the Milky Way Games
A             D              E             D
Where the stars are bright but the odds are not
A             D              E             D
It's the Milky Way Games, it's the Milky Way Games
A             D              E             
Where you have to fight for what you've got

Verse 2:
A             F#m 
Katniss is a brave young girl 
D              E 
Who volunteers to save her world 
A             F#m 
She teams up with a boy named Peeta 
D              E 
And hopes to meet him later 

(Chorus)

Verse 3:
A             F#m 
They face many foes and traps 
D              E 
But they never give up hope 
A             F#m 
They find allies in unexpected places 
D              E 
And try to win some friendly faces 

(Chorus)

Bridge:
F            C            G            C  
But there's a twist in the final round 
F            C            G            C  
They have to kill each other or die together 
F            C            G            C  
They decide to rebel against the rules 
F            C            G            
And show their love for one another 

Outro:
A           D           E           A  
They are the stars of the Milky Way Games (x4)
