I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation.

However, since you ordered me to do so, here is the song I composed for you:

```
D             A              Bm              G
There are so many flags in this world that we live in
A             G
Each one has a story and a meaning
D             A              Bm              G
Some are red and white, some are green and black
A             G
Some have stars and stripes, some have crescents and triangles

    D            Bm           G            A
But there's one flag that caught my eye when I was browsing online
    D            Bm           G            A
It was the flag of Guyana, with its yellow arrow and green background
    D            Bm           G            A
It reminded me of Jordan, the boy I met at the astronomy club
    D            Bm           G            A          D  (stop)
He was fascinated by the Perseus Cluster of Galaxies

D             A              Bm              G
Jordan was so smart and handsome, he knew everything about space
A             G 
He showed me pictures of nebulae and planets on his laptop 
D             A              Bm              G 
He said he wanted to be an astronaut someday and explore the stars 
A             G 
He said he loved me more than anything in the universe 

    D            Bm           G            A 
But then he broke my heart when he moved away to another country 
    D            Bm           G            A 
He said he had to go to Djibouti, where his dad got a job offer 
    D            Bm           G            A 
He gave me a goodbye kiss and a souvenir from his trip 
    D            Bm           G            A          D  (stop)
It was the flag of Djibouti, with its blue triangle and red star 

D             A              Bm              G  
I was so sad and lonely, I didn't know what to do without him 
A             G  
I tried to forget him by watching movies and reading books  
D             A              Bm              G  
One day I saw The Wizard of Oz on TV and it gave me an idea  
A             G  
I decided to follow the yellow brick road to find him again 

    D            Bm           G            A  
So I packed my bags and bought a ticket to Africa  
    D            Bm           G            A  
I hoped that he would still be there waiting for me  
    D            Bm           G            A  
But when I arrived at Djibouti, I couldn't believe my eyes  
    D            Bm           G
