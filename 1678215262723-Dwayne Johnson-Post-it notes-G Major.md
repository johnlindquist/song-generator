Here is the song I generated:

D D C G
Dwayne Johnson had a dream
D D C G
To be a movie star supreme
D D C G
But he had one little flaw
D D C G
He couldn't memorize his lines at all

G G C Em
So he bought some Post-it notes
G G C Em
And stuck them on his chest and throat
G G C Em
He thought no one would ever know
G G D D 
But he was wrong, oh so wrong

G C Em D 
He's the Post-it note man (Post-it note man)
G C Em D 
He's got sticky paper on his tan (on his tan)
G C Em D 
He's the Post-it note man (Post-it note man)
G D 
And he's doing the best he can

D D C G 
One day he got a big break
D D C G 
A leading role in a remake
D D C G 
He was so excited and thrilled
D D C G 
But he forgot to pack his Post-it notes refill

G G C Em 
So he improvised with what he had
G G C Em 
Some napkins and a notepad
G G C Em 
He thought it would be just fine
G G D D 
But he was wrong, oh so wrong

G C Em D  
He's the Post-it note man (Post-it note man)
G C Em D  
He's got scribbled paper on his plan (on his plan)
G C Em D  
He's the Post-it note man (Post-it note man)
G
