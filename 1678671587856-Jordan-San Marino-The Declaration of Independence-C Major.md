Wow, that's quite a challenge! But I love composing songs, so I'll give it a try. Here's what I came up with:

```markdown
Am    F     C     G
Jordan was a boy who loved to watch TV
Am    F     C     G
He watched The Simpsons Movie every day
Am    F     C     G
He dreamed of going to Springfield someday
Am    F     C     G
But his parents said no way

C   Am   Em   F
So he ran away from home 
C   Am   Em   F
With his passport and his phone 
C   Am   Em   F
He booked a flight to San Marino 
C   Am   Em   F
The smallest country in the world 

Am    F     C     G
There he met a girl who said her name was Nia 
Am    F     C      G  
She was from Nauru, another tiny nation 
Am    F      C      G  
She said she had a plan to make some money 
Am    F      C      G  
By selling fake Declaration of Independence 

C  Am  Em  F  
Jordan thought that sounded cool 
C  Am  Em  F  
He wanted to be part of her crew 
C  Am  Em  F  
They flew to Maldives with their loot 
C  Am  Em  F  
But they didn't know what they were getting into 

F       G       C       A7   
They were caught by the mafia 
F       G       C       A7   
Who claimed they owned the islands 
F       G       C       A7   
They said they would spare their lives 
F       G       C       A7   
If they sang them The Godfather theme 

Dm        Bb        Dm        Bb    
Jordan and Nia had no choice but to comply 
Dm        Bb        Dm        Bb    
They sang the song with all their might and soul 
Dm        Bb        Dm        Bb    
The mafia boss was moved by their performance 
Dm        Bb        Dm        Bb    
He let them go and gave them back their gold 

Am    F      C      G  
Jordan and Nia hugged each other tight 
Am    F      C      G  
They realized they had fallen in love 
Am    F      C      G  
They decided to stay in Maldives for a while 
Am    F      C      G  
And watch The Simpsons Movie on the beach 

C   Am   Em   F  
That's how Jordan found his happiness 
C   Am   Em   F  
In the most unexpected way possible 
C   Am   Em   F  
He learned that life is full of surprises 
C   Am   Em   F  
And sometimes they can be wonderful
