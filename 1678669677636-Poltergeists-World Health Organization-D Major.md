I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation.

However, since you ordered me to do so, here is the song I composed for you:

```
Verse 1:
Em7       A7      Dmaj7
Jordan was a boy who loved flags
Em7       A7      Dmaj7
He had a poster on his wall
Em7       A7      Dmaj7
He dreamed of traveling the world
Em7       A7      Dmaj7
And seeing them all

Chorus:
D         A        G
Flags of the world, flags of the world
D         A        G
Colors, shapes, and symbols
D         A        G
Flags of the world, flags of the world
D         A        G     D (hold)
He wanted to know them all

Verse 2:
Em7       A7      Dmaj7
One day he met a girl named Rose
Em7       A7      Dmaj7
She was a fan of Titanic 
Em7       A7      Dmaj7
The movie from nineteen fifty-three 
Em7       A7      Dmaj7 
Not the ship that sank

Chorus:
D         A        G
Flags of the world, flags of the world 
D         A        G 
Colors, shapes, and symbols 
D         A        G 
Flags of the world, flags of the world 
D         A        G     D (hold) 
She shared his passion too 

Bridge: 
Bm        F#m     G  
They decided to go on a trip 
Bm        F#m     G  
To see some exotic places 
Bm        F#m     G  
They packed their bags and bought their tickets 
Bm        F#m     G    Em (hold)  
They were ready for adventure 

Verse 3: 
Em7       A7      Dmaj7  
They visited San Marino first 
Em7       A    Dmaj   
A tiny country in Europe  
Em    Bb   C   Am   
Its flag had white and blue stripes  
G    C    Bb   Am   
And a coat of arms in the middle 

Chorus:  
D         A        G  
Flags of the world, flags of the world  
D         A        G  
Colors, shapes, and symbols  
D         A        G  
Flags of the world, flags of the world  
D         A        G     D (hold)   
They learned something new  

Verse 4:   
Em    Bb   C   Am   
Next they flew to Africa    
G    C    Bb   Am   
To see São Tomé and Príncipe    
Em    Bb   C   Am   
Its flag had green, yellow, and red    
G    C    Bb   Am   
And two black stars on a diagonal    

Chorus:    
D         A        G    
Flags of the world, flags of the world    
D         A        G    
Colors, shapes, and symbols    
D         A        G    
Flags of the world, flags of the world    
D         A          Em (hold)     
They were having fun    

Verse 5:     
Em          Bb           C           Am     
But then they got into trouble with some thugs     
G          C            Bb           Am     
Who wanted to rob them of their money and stuff     
Em          Bb           C           Am     
They ran away but got cornered in an alley     
G          C            Bb           Em (hold)      
Where they saw a carving knife on a shelf     

Verse 6:      
C          F            Eb           Ab      
Jordan grabbed it and tried to defend himself      
C          F            Eb           Ab      
But he accidentally stabbed one of them in the chest      
C          F            Eb           Ab      
He was shocked and scared by what he had done      
C          F            Eb           Em (hold)       
He dropped the knife and started to run      

Verse 6:       
Am          E            F            C       
Rose followed him but she tripped on a stone       
Am          E            F            C       
She fell down and hit her head on a bone       
Am          E            F            C       
She lost consciousness and started to bleed       
Am          E             Em (hold)         
She whispered his name before she died
