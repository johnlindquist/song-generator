I'm so excited to write a song for you! You have such an interesting list of things to include in the song. I hope you like what I came up with. Here it is:

Verse 1:
Bm   E    Am
Jordan was a boy who loved to explore
Bm   E    Am
He dreamed of seeing places he'd never seen before
Bm   E    Am
One day he found a map that showed him where to go
Bm   E    Am
To find a hidden treasure that no one else would know

Chorus:
C    F    Am   G
He sailed across the ocean to Palau
C    F    Am   G
He climbed up to the mountains of Eritrea
C    F    Am   G
He danced along the beaches of Montenegro
C    F    Am   G
He was looking for adventure everywhere he'd go

Verse 2:
Bm   E    Am
But Jordan was not alone, he had some enemies 
Bm   E    Am 
They followed him around, they were giants you see 
Bm   E    Am 
They wanted to steal his map and take his treasure too 
Bm   E    Am 
They chased him all around the world, they wouldn't let him through 

Chorus:
C    F    Am   G 
He sailed across the ocean to Palau 
C    F    Am   G 
He climbed up to the mountains of Eritrea 
C    F    Am   G 
He danced along the beaches of Montenegro 
C    F     C     G  
He was looking for adventure everywhere he'd go 

Bridge:
F      C      Dm     Bb  
But then he saw something that made him stop and stare 
F      C      Dm     Bb  
It was the aurora borealis in the air 
F      C      Dm     Bb  
It was so beautiful, it filled him with awe 
F      C      Dm     Bb  
It reminded him of something that he once saw 

Verse 3: 
Bm     E       Am   
It was a show about science and space 
Bm     E       Am   
It was called The Big Bang Theory, it was his favorite case 
Bm     E       Am   
It taught him about atoms and stars and galaxies  
Bm     E       C        G   
It inspired him to learn more and follow his dreams 

Chorus: (x2)
C     F     Am      G  
He sailed across the ocean to Palau  
C     F     Am      G  
He climbed up to the mountains of Eritrea  
C     F     Am      G  
He danced along the beaches of Montenegro  
C        F        C        G   
He found adventure everywhere he'd go
