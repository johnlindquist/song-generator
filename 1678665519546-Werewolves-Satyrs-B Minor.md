Sure thing, boss! I love composing songs, especially parodies. Here's what I came up with:

# Flags of the World

Bm   G    D    A
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel
Bm   G    D    A
He wanted to see every flag unfurl
Bm   G    D    A
But then he caught a nasty influenza
Bm   G    D    A
And had to stay at home and watch the world

D     Bm     F#m     G
He saw the flag of Guyana waving high
D     Bm     F#m     G
Green for forests, yellow for gold, red for zeal
D     Bm     F#m     G
He saw the flag of Montenegro in the sky
D     Bm     F#m     G 
Gold for royalty, red for blood, white for peace

G      D      Bm      A 
But he felt so lonely and so bored 
G      D      Bm      A 
He needed something more than flags to adore 
G      D      Bm      A 
So he turned on his TV and watched a movie 
G      D      Bm      A 
The one with superheroes and a big finale 

D       A       Bm       G  
He saw the Avengers fight against Thanos 
D       A       Bm       G  
He saw them sacrifice and lose and win 
D       A       Bm       G  
He saw them unite under one banner 
D       A       Bm       G  
The flag of Earth with stars and stripes within 

G      D      Bm      A 
But he felt so sad and so depressed 
G      D      Bm      A 
He needed something more than heroes to impress 
G      D      Bm      A 
So he turned on his laptop and searched online 
G      D      Bm      A  
The one with science and a tiny particle 

D        Bm        F#M        G  
He learned about the top quark and its mass 
D        Bm        F#M        G  
He learned about its charge and spin and flavor 
D        BM        F#M        G  
He learned about its role in matter's dance 
D        BM        F#M        G  
The flag of physics with quarks and leptons together 

G         D         BM         A   
But he felt so curious and so intrigued   
G         D         BM         A   
He needed something more than quarks to achieve   
G         D         BM         A   
So he turned off his devices and looked outside   
G         D         BM         A    
The one with nature and a beautiful sight   

B          GM          DM          AM          
He saw the flag of Kyrgyzstan on a hill     
B          GM          DM          AM          
Red for bravery, yellow for sun, blue for sky     
B          GM          DM          AM          
He saw it fly with pride and grace and skill     
B          GM          DM          AM          
And he felt a surge of joy that made him cry     

AM           EM           BM           FM           
And he realized that flags are more than colors     
AM           EM           BM           FM           
They are symbols of history, culture, identity     
AM           EM           BM           FM           
They are stories of people, places, wonders     
AM           EM           BM           FM           
They are flags of the world that make us free
