Wow, that's quite a challenge! But I love composing songs, so I'll give it my best shot. Here's what I came up with:

```markdown
Dm        G7       C
Jordan was an average boy
Dm        G7       C
Living in São Tomé
Dm        G7       C
He dreamed of seeing other lands
Dm        G7       C
Especially Seychelles

F         C         Am        Dm
But his parents were too busy working
F         C         Am        Dm
They ran a nuclear power plant 
F         C         Am        Dm
They said it was for the greater good 
F         C         Am        Dm
But Jordan didn't understand

Gm        A7       Dm        
He wanted to have some fun 
Gm        A7       Dm        
He wanted to see the sun 
Gm        A7       Dm        
He wanted to sail away 
Gm        A7       Dm        
To a place where he could play 

F         C         Am        Dm        
So he packed his bags one night 
F         C         Am        Dm        
And snuck out of his home 
F         C         Am        Dm        
He found a boat that looked alright 
F         C         Am        Dm        
And set off on his own 

Dm        G7       C         
He sailed across the ocean blue 
Dm        G7       C         
He saw many sights and wonders 
Dm        G7       C         
He reached the islands of Comoros 
Dm        G7       C         
Where he met some friendly monsters 

F         C         Am        Dm         
They were ghouls but they were nice 
F         C         Am        Dm         
They taught him how to dance and sing 
F         C         Am        Dm         
They said he could stay with them forever 
F         C          Am      Bb  A  Ab  G  
But Jordan had other plans

G          Em      B  
He wanted to see more of the world  
G          Em      B  
He wanted to learn new things  
G          Em      B  
He wanted to find his way back home  
G          Em      B  
To his parents and his friends  

C          G          Em     B   
So he thanked the ghouls for their kindness   
C          G          Em     B   
And boarded another boat   
C          G          Em     B   
He sailed through the Panama Canal   
C          G           Em    F   E   Eb  Db    
Where he had a close encounter  

Db           Ab    F#    Db    
With a giant squid that tried to eat him    
Db           Ab    F#    Db    
But he escaped with some help from a whale    
Db           Ab    F#    Db    
Who told him stories of the deep sea    
Db           Ab    F#    Db    
And gave him directions to Seychelles    

Eb            Ab            F#            Db            
Jordan was amazed by what he saw there     
Eb            Ab            F#            Db            
The beaches, the mountains, the wildlife     
Eb            Ab            F#            Db            
He felt like he had found paradise     
Eb             Ab             F#             Eb   E   F   F#
But he also felt something else inside  

Gb           Eb      Bb     Eb     
A longing for his family     
Gb           Eb      Bb     Eb     
A guilt for leaving them behind     
Gb           Eb      Bb     Eb     
A hope that they would forgive him     
Gb           Eb      Bb     Eb      
A love that he could not deny  

Bb             Eb             Bb              F             
So he decided to go back home      
Bb             Eb             Bb              F             
To face his parents and tell them everything      
Bb             Eb             Bb              F             
To apologize for being selfish      
Bb              Eb              Bb               E   Esus4  E       
To show them how much he had grown      

E               A               E               A               
He sailed back to São Tomé       
E               A               E               A               
With a smile on his face       
E               A               E               A               
He arrived at his home sweet home       
E                A                E                Esus4  E       
Where he was welcomed with embrace
