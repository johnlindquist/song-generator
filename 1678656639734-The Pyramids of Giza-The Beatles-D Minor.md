Here is the song I composed for you:

```
Dm       A        Gm       A
Jordan is turning eleven today
Dm       A        Gm       A
He loves geography in every way
Dm       A        Gm       A
He knows all the flags of the world
Dm       A        Gm       A
He likes to draw them on his school board

Dm      A      Bb     F
But he has a secret dream
Dm      A      Bb     F
He wants to see them for real
Dm      A      Bb     F
He wishes he could travel far
Gm      C      Dm     Am 
And have some amazing adventures

Gm      C      Dm     Am 
So he sings this little song
Gm      C      Dm     Am 
To make his birthday wish come true
Gm      C      Dm     Am 
He hopes that someone will hear him
Bb     F    G    (A)
And take him to somewhere new

Dm       A        Gm       A  
Jordan wants to see the pyramids of Giza  
Dm       A        Gm       A  
He wants to learn about their ancient history  
Dm       A        Gm       A  
He wants to ride a camel in the desert  
Dm       A        Gm       (A)  
And take some pictures with his camera  

(chorus)

Dm       A        Gm       (A)  
Jordan wants to meet the Beatles in Liverpool  
Dm       A        Gm         (A)   
He wants to hear their music and their stories  
Dm          A         G          (A)   
He wants to visit Abbey Road and Strawberry Fields   
D   m         (A)         (G)    m   (A)    
And sing along with John and Paul and George and Ringo  

(chorus)

(Bridge)
Bb    F    C    D 
But Jordan knows that dreams are not enough 
Bb    F    C    D 
He has to work hard and never give up 
Bb    F    C    D 
He has to study hard and learn new things 
Bb   F   C  (E)
And maybe someday he will get his wings 

(chorus)

(Final verse)
(D)m   (E)   Am  E   
Jordan loves Kosovo and its flag   
(D)m   (E)   Am  E   
It has six stars and a blue background   
(D)m   (E)   Am  E   
It represents its people and its culture   
(D)m   E  Am  E    
It makes him feel proud and inspired   

(Final chorus)
Am  E  C  G    
So he sings this little song    
Am  E  C  G    
To thank the world for being so diverse    
Am  E  C  G    
He hopes that everyone will live in peace    
F   C   Dsus2     
And share their dreams with each other
