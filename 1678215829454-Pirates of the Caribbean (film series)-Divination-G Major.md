Am   D7   G
Jack Sparrow had a vision
Am   D7   G
Of a treasure beyond measure
Am   D7   G
But he needed a magician
Am   D7  Em  Am  D7
To unlock its hidden power

G    D    Em    Bm    C
He sailed across the ocean blue
G    D    Em    Bm    C
Looking for a crystal ball
G    D    Em    Bm    C
He found a lady named Tia Dalma 
G     D     C      G/B     Am     G/B     C      D 
Who said she could reveal it all

G       C       Am       Em       F       C       G        D 
She's the queen of divination, she can see the future clear 
G       C       Am       Em       F        C        G      D 
She can tell you what you want to know, or what you fear 
G       C      Am      Em      F        C         G         D 
She can use her cards and bones, or even Marker's equation 
G        C        Am         Em          F          C           G/B         Am         G/B         C          D          G  
She's the queen of divination, and she's got a proposition for Jack Sparrow

Am   D7   G
She said she'd help him find the chest
Am   D7   G
That contained the heart of Davy Jones
Am   D7   G
But he had to pass a test
Am   D7  Em  Am  D7  
To prove he was worthy of its throne

G     D     Em     Bm     C  
He had to face his greatest foe 
G     D     Em     Bm     C  
The undead pirate Barbossa 
G      D      Em      Bm      C  
He had to solve a riddle too 
G      D      C        G/B        Am        G/B        C         D   
That involved the SchrÃ¶dinger equation 

G       C       Am       Em       F       C       G        D 
She's the queen of divination, she can see the future clear 
G       C       Am       Em       F        C        G      D 
She can tell you what you want to know, or what you fear 
G       C      Am      Em      F        C         G         D 
She can use her cards and bones, or even Marker's equation 
G        C        Am         Em          F          C           G/B         Am         G/B         C          D          G  
She's the queen of divination, and she's got a proposition for Jack Sparrow

Am    E/G#  A/C#  A/D  A/E  A/F#  A/G#  A/A#
Will he succeed in his quest? 

Bb/F Eb/G Ab/C Ab/Db Ab/Eb Ab/F Ab/G Ab/Ab#
Will he win the heart of Elizabeth? 

B/F# E/G# A/C# A/D A/E A/F# A/G# A/A#
Will he survive the curse of the Black Pearl? 

C/G F/A Bb/D Bb/Eb Bb/F Bb/G Bb/Ab Bb/Bb#
Will he ever learn how to read his own tarot?

D/A E/G# A/C# A/D A/E A/F# E/G#
No one knows but her 

A/C# E/G#
She's the queen 

A/C# E/G#
Of divination 

A/C# E/G#
And she holds 

A/C# E/G#
The key 

A/C# E/G#
To his fate
