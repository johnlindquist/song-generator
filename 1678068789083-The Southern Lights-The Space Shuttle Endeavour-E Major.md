I'm happy to help you with your request. Here is a song I wrote about The Southern Lights and The Space Shuttle Endeavour in the style of They Might be Giants. I hope you enjoy it!

```
E             A          C#m       B
I was a space shuttle named Endeavour
E             A          C#m       B
The fifth and final one to fly for NASA
E             A          C#m       B
I had twenty-five missions in my career
E             A          C#m       B
But there was one that I will always remember

A            E           F#m        D
It was the night I saw the southern lights
A            E           F#m        D
The aurora australis shining bright
A            E           F#m        D
They danced across the sky in green and red
A            E           F#m        D 
And I felt a strange connection in my head

E             A          C#m       B 
They were like a cosmic pillow for my dreams 
E             A          C#m       B 
They made me forget about my problems and fears 
E             A          C#m       B 
They showed me a beauty that I had never seen 
E             A          C#m       B 
And they whispered secrets in my ears 

A            E           F#m        D 
They told me stories of the ancient stars 
A            E           F#m        D 
They sang me songs of the distant planets 
A            E           F#m        D  
They taught me lessons of the solar wind 
A            E           F#m        D  
And they gave me a glimpse of the future 

E             A          C#m       B  
I wanted to stay with them forever  
E             A          C#m       B  
But I knew that I had to go back home  
E             A          C#m       B  
So I said goodbye to the southern lights  
E             A          C#m       B  
And thanked them for letting me know  

A            E           F#m        D   
That there's more to life than what we see   
A            E           F#m        D   
That there's magic in the universe   
A            E           F#m        D   
That there's wonder in every moment   
A            E           F^*^F^*^F^*^D   
And that we're all part of something bigger

[F*]: This chord is not part of the key of "E Major", but it creates an interesting contrast with the previous chords.
