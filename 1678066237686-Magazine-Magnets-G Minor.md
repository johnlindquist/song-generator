Here is a song I wrote about a magazine and magnets in the style of They Might be Giants. I hope you enjoy it!

```markdown
Gm  D  Bb  Eb  F
She was a magazine editor with a passion for history
He was a magnet salesman who traveled across the sea
They met in Paris during the Second World War
And they fell in love like they never did before

Cm  D  Gm
But their love was not meant to last
Cm  D  Gm
They had to part when the war was past
Cm  D  Gm
She went back to New York with a broken heart
Cm  D  Gm
He stayed in Europe with his magnets and his art

Gm  D  Bb  Eb  F
She kept his letters in a drawer by her bed
He kept her picture in a locket around his neck
They never forgot each other even as they grew old
They always wondered what might have been if they had been more bold

Cm  D  Gm 
But their love was not meant to be 
Cm  D  Gm 
They had different lives and destinies 
Cm  D   Gm 
She became a famous writer of historical fiction 
Cm   D   Gm 
He became a renowned inventor of magnetic contraptions 

Gm   D   Bb   Eb   F 
One day she saw his name on a magazine cover 
He had created a device that could make things hover 
She felt a surge of curiosity and nostalgia 
She decided to write him a letter after all these years 

Cm   D   Gm  
But her letter never reached him  
Cm   D   Gm  
It got lost in the mail somewhere  
Cm   D    Gm  
He never knew that she still cared for him  
Cm    D    Gm  
He never knew that she wanted to see him again 

G    C    Em    Am    F   
They died without ever knowing the truth  
They died without ever saying goodbye  
They died without ever fulfilling their dreams  
They died without ever giving their love another try  

F    C    G   
But their love was not lost forever   
F     C     G   
It lived on in their words and deeds   
F     C     G   
It inspired generations of readers and inventors   
F      C      G   
It transcended time and space with its power and beauty   

G    
The end.```
