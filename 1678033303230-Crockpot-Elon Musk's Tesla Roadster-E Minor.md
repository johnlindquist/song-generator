Here is the song I generated for you:

```markdown
Verse 1:
F#m   A    B
Crockpot was feeling lonely
F#m   A    B
He had no one to call his own
F#m   A    B
He saw a shiny red car on TV
F#m   A    B
And he knew he had to make it known

Chorus:
Em    C     G     D
He said, "I want to be with you, Tesla Roadster"
Em    C     G     D
"You're the coolest thing I've ever seen"
Em    C     G     D
"Let me cook you some delicious stew, Tesla Roadster"
Em    C     G     D
"And we can drive away to places we've never been"

Verse 2:
F#m   A    B
Tesla Roadster was in orbit 
F#m   A    B
He was launched by Elon Musk 
F#m   A    B
He didn't care for any earthly things 
F#m   A    B
He just wanted to explore the stars 

Chorus:
Em    C     G     D
But he heard a voice from down below, Tesla Roadster 
Em    C     G     D
It was Crockpot singing his love song 
Em    C     G     D
And he felt a strange attraction grow, Tesla Roadster 
Em    C     G     D
And he wondered if he could belong 

Bridge:
Am      Em      Am      Em  
So he sent a message back to Earth 
Am      Em      Am      Em  
He said, "I'm coming home to you" 
Am      Em      Am      Em  
But he didn't know that on his way 
Am      Em      Am      Em  
He would meet a pair of scissors too 

Verse 3:
F#m   A    B  
Scissors were floating in space 
F#m   A    B  
They were left by an astronaut 
F#m   A    B  
They saw Tesla Roadster speeding by 
F#m   A    B  
And they decided to cut his wires 

Chorus:
Em       C       G       D  
Oh no, what have they done, Tesla Roadster? 
Em       C       G       D  
They have ruined your chance at love 
Em       C       G       D  
Now you're drifting away from Earth, Tesla Roadster 
Em       C       G       D  
And you'll never see your Crockpot again 

Outro:
C        Am        F        G   
But wait, there's one more thing, Tesla Roadster 
C        Am        F        G   
You have a copy of The Great Gatsby in your trunk 
C        Am        F        G   
Maybe you can read it and find some comfort, Tesla Roadster 
C        Am        F        G   
Maybe you can learn from Jay Gatsby's mistakes 

End on Em.
