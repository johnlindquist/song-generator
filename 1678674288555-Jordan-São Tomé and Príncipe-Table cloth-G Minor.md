I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation. I'm still learning so I appreciate your understanding and patience.üôè

Just kidding! Here's your song:

```
Gm D7 Cm
Jordan was a boy who loved to travel
Gm D7 Cm
He had a map of every country on his wall
Gm D7 Cm
He dreamed of seeing places far and wide
Gm D7 Cm
But he never had the chance to leave at all

Eb Bb F Gm
Until one day he found a magic table cloth
Eb Bb F Gm
That could take him anywhere he wished to go
Eb Bb F Gm
He grabbed his backpack and his favorite perfume
Eb Bb F Gm 
And he said goodbye to everything he knew

D7 Gm Eb F 
He went to S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe 
D7 Gm Eb F 
And danced with the locals on the beach 
D7 Gm Eb F 
He went to Lesotho and climbed the mountains high 
D7 Gm Eb F 
And saw the beauty of the sky 

Gm D7 Cm 
He went to Andorra and explored the ancient streets 
Gm D7 Cm 
And learned about their history and culture 
Gm D7 Cm 
He went to Rome and marveled at the Sistine Chapel 
Gm D7 Cn  
And felt a connection with the art 

Eb Bb F Gn  
But as he traveled around the world 
Eb Bb F Gn  
He realized something was missing in his heart 
Eb Bb F Gn  
He missed his family and his friends back home 
Eb Bb F Gn  
And he wondered if he should have left at all 

D7 Gn Eb Fn  
So he took out his magic table cloth  
D7 Gn Eb Fn  
And wished for one more place to see  
D7 Gn Eb Fn  
He closed his eyes and hoped for something special   
D7 Gn Eb Fn   
And when he opened them, he couldn't believe 

Gn Dn Cn   
He was back in his own bedroom, safe and sound   
Gn Dn Cn   
With his map of every country on his wall   
Gn Dn Cn   
He smiled and hugged his magic table cloth   
Gn Dn Cn   
And said thank you for the greatest trip of all   

Eb Bb Fn Gn    
'Cause he had seen S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe    
Eb Bb Fn Gn    
And danced with the locals on the beach    
Eb Bb Fn Gn    
He had seen Lesotho and climbed the mountains high    
Eb Bb Fn Gn    
And saw the beauty of the sky    

Fn Gn Eb Bb     
But now he was happy to be home again     
Fn Gn Eb Bb     
With his family and his friends by his side     
Fn Gn Eb Bb     
He knew that he would always have his memories     
Fn Gn Eb Bb     
And his magic table cloth for another ride      
```

I hope you like it! üòä
