Thank you for your kind words and your request. I will try my best to compose a song for you. Here is what I came up with:

```markdown
Em    C     G      D
Jordan is turning eleven
Em    C     G      D
He loves geography and heaven
Em    C     G      D
He knows all the flags of the world
Em    C     G      D
And he dreams of flying like a bird

G     C      D       G
He wants to see the Butterfly Nebula
G     C      D       G
And find some holy artifacts on Earth
G     C      D       G
He wants to visit Vanuatu and Fiji
G     C      D       G
And celebrate his birthday with some mirth

Em    C     G      D 
Jordan has a map and a compass 
Em    C     G      D 
He likes to explore and learn new things 
Em    C     G      D 
He reads about stars and ancient cultures 
Em    C     G      D 
And he sings along to his favorite songs 

G     C      D       G 
He wants to see the Butterfly Nebula 
G     C      D       G 
And find some holy artifacts on Earth 
G     C      D       G 
He wants to visit Vanuatu and Fiji 
G     C      D       G 
And celebrate his birthday with some mirth 

Bridge: 

Am   Em   Am   Em  
Jordan, Jordan, you're so bright 
Am   Em   Am   Em  
You make the world a better sight 

C    Bm   Am  Bm  
You have a curious mind and a kind heart 
C    Bm   Am  Bm  
You have a wonderful start for your next part 

G     C      D       G  
He wants to see the Butterfly Nebula  
G     C      D       G  
And find some holy artifacts on Earth  
G     C      D       G  
He wants to visit Vanuatu and Fiji  
G     C      D       G  
And celebrate his birthday with some mirth  

Outro: 

Em    C     
Jordan, Jordan, happy birthday   
G        D   
We hope you have an awesome day   
Em        C     
Jordan, Jordan, we love you so   
G         D   
Wherever you go, we'll always know   

End on: 

G
