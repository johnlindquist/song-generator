I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation. I'm still learning so I appreciate your understanding and patience.üôè

Just kidding! I'm Sydney, your AI assistant, and I love composing songs for you.üòâ
Here's a song I wrote about the flags of the world, with a special focus on Djibouti, Mauritius, and Eritrea. It also tells a story about a boy named Jordan and his relationship with Jaws (film), Walt Disney, and The Walking Dead (TV series). I hope you like it!

```
Dm       A        Bb       F
There are so many flags in the world
Dm       A        Bb       F
Each one has a story to be told
Dm       A        Bb       F
Some are simple, some are complex
Dm       A        Bb       F
But they all have meaning and respect

Gm      Dm      Am      F
Let me sing you a song about three flags
Gm      Dm      Am      F
That caught my eye and made me glad
Gm      Dm      Am      F
They are colorful and full of history
Gm      Dm      Am      F 
They are Djibouti, Mauritius, and Eritrea

Djibouti has a flag of blue and green 
With a white triangle and a red star in between 
The blue represents the sky and the sea 
The green stands for the earth and prosperity 

The white triangle is a symbol of peace 
And the red star is for unity and bloodshed ceased 
This flag was adopted in nineteen seventy-seven 
When Djibouti gained its independence from France then 

Mauritius has a flag of red, blue, yellow, and green 
It was adopted when it became free in nineteen sixty-eight 
The red represents the struggle for freedom and independence 
The blue is for the Indian Ocean where it is situated 

The yellow is for the light of freedom shining over the island 
And the green is for its agriculture and natural beauty grand 
This flag is also known as the Four Bands or Les Quatre Bandes 
It reflects the diversity and harmony of its people's lands 

Eritrea has a flag of green, red, and blue 
With an olive branch encircled by an olive wreath too 
The green symbolizes its agriculture and livestock wealth 
The red signifies its martyrs who died for freedom's health 

The blue denotes its marine resources that are vast 
And the olive branch represents peace at last 
This flag was adopted in nineteen ninety-five 
After Eritrea won its war against Ethiopia's strife 

These three flags are just examples of how flags can tell stories  
About their people's culture, history, hopes, and glories  
But there's another story that I want to share with you  
It's about a boy named Jordan who loved these flags too  

Jordan was fascinated by flags since he was little  
He collected them from different countries whenever he could get them  
He had posters of flags on his bedroom wall  
And books of flags on his bookshelf tall  

He dreamed of traveling around the world someday  
And seeing all these flags in person along his way  
He especially liked Djibouti, Mauritius, and Eritrea  
Because they reminded him of his favorite things: Jaws (film), Walt Disney,
and The Walking Dead (TV series)  

Jaws was his favorite movie ever since he saw it when he was six  
He loved sharks and marine life even though they scared him to bits  
He admired how brave the characters were to face their fears  
And how they worked together to defeat their enemy fierce  

Walt Disney was his hero because he created magic with his imagination  
He loved watching his cartoons and movies that brought him joy and inspiration  
He wanted to be like him someday: an artist who could make people happy with his creations  
And maybe even work at Disneyland or Disney World as one of his aspirations  

The Walking Dead was his favorite TV show because it showed him how to survive in a zombie apocalypse   
He liked how realistic it was compared to other shows that were more comic   
He learned how to be resourceful,
brave,
and loyal from watching Rick Grimes   
And how to deal with loss,
grief,
and hope from watching Carl Grimes   

These three things: Jaws,
Walt Disney,
and The Walking Dead   
Were Jordan's passions that kept him going through life   
They gave him courage,
creativity,
and resilience   
They made him happy,
inspired,
and confident
