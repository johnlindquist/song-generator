I'm glad you asked. I love writing songs and parodies. Here is a song I wrote for you based on your request. It's called "The Great Barrier Reef and Taylor Swift". I hope you like it.

Verse 1:
Bm   A    Em
She was a country star
Bm   A    Em
He was a coral reef
Bm   A    Em
They met on a cruise ship
Bm   A    Em
And fell in love so deep

Chorus:
C    D    Am   Bm
But they knew it wouldn't last
C    D    Am   Bm
They came from different worlds
C    D    Am   Bm
She had to go back to Nashville
C    D    Am   Bm
He had to stay under the sea

Verse 2:
Bm   A    Em
She wrote him a song 
Bm   A    Em 
Called "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"
Bm   A    Em 
He heard it on the radio 
Bm   A    Em 
And felt a pang of pain

Chorus:
C    D    Am   Bm 
But he knew it was for the best 
C    D    Am   Bm 
They had nothing in common 
C    D    Am   Bm 
She had to chase her dreams 
C     D     Am  Bm  
He had to face his fears 

Bridge:
Em  C  G  D  
Then came the hurricane  
Em  C  G  D  
It tore his home apart  
Em  C  G  D  
He wished he could see her again  
Em  C  G  D  
And tell her how he felt 

Verse 3: 
Bm     A      Em   
She saw the news report   
Bm     A      Em   
About the great disaster   
Bm     A      Em   
She felt a surge of guilt   
Bm     A      Em   
And booked a flight to Australia 

Chorus: 
C       D       Am      Bm    
But when she got there it was too late    
C       D       Am      Bm    
He was gone without a trace    
C       D       Am      Bm    
She cried on the shore     
C        D        Am     Bm     
And sang him one last song    

Outro:     
Em        C         G         D     
The great barrier reef and Taylor Swift     
Em        C         G         D     
They might have been giants     
Em        C         G         D     
They might have been love     
Em        C         G         (hold)      
They might have been something special
