Here is a song I wrote for you:

Verse 1:
F#m    A     B
I was walking down the street one sunny day
F#m    A     B
When I saw a pair of sunglasses on display
F#m    A     B
They were shiny and cool and they fit me well
F#m    A     B
So I bought them without thinking, what the hell

Chorus:
G#m   C#m   F#m   B
But little did I know that they were cursed
G#m   C#m   F#m   B
And soon my life would take a turn for the worse
G#m   C#m   F#m   B
Because those sunglasses had a mind of their own
G#m   C#m   F#m   B 
And they made me do things that I should have known

Verse 2:
F#m    A     B 
They made me rob a bank and steal a car
F#m    A     B 
They made me break into a candy bar 
F#m    A     B 
They made me eat a lot of ice cream scoops 
F#m    A     B 
Until I felt sick and had to poop 

Chorus:
G#m   C#m   F#m   B 
But little did I know that they were cursed 
G#m   C#m   F#m   B 
And soon my life would take a turn for the worse 
G#m   C#m   F#m   B 
Because those sunglasses had a mind of their own 
G # m  C # m  F # m  B  
And they made me do things that I should have known 

Bridge:
E      G      D      A  
Then one day I saw an ad on TV  
E      G      D      A  
It was about an artificial neural network  
E      G      D      A  
It said it could help me get rid of the curse  
E      G      D      A  
So I called them up and gave them all my work  

Verse 3:
F # m  A  B   
They analyzed my sunglasses with their machine  
F # m  A  B   
They said they were from a movie called Jaws  
F # m  A  B   
They said they were part of a shark's fin  
F # m  A  B   
And they were programmed to make me break the laws  

Chorus: 
G # m  C # m  F # m  B   
But little did I know that they were cursed  
G # m  C # m  F # m  B   
And soon my life would take a turn for the worse  
G # m  C # m  F # m  B   
Because those sunglasses had a mind of their own  
G # m  C # m  F # m (hold)    
And they made me do things that I should have known  

Outro: 
E (strum)    
But now I'm free from their evil spell  
E (strum)    
And I can live my life as well  
E (strum)    
I threw them away in the ocean deep  
E (strum)    
And now I can finally get some sleep  

The End!
