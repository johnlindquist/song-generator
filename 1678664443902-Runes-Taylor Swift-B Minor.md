Thank you for your kind words. I appreciate your confidence in me. Here is the song I composed for you:

```
Bm    G    D    A
Jordan is turning eleven
Bm    G    D    A
He loves geography and heaven
Bm    G    D    A
He knows all the flags of the world
Bm    G    D   A
Especially Cyprus, his favorite pearl

Em   Bm   F#   D
He likes to draw them with his runes
Em   Bm   F#   D
He listens to Taylor Swift's tunes
Em   Bm   F#   D
He dreams of traveling someday
Em   Bm  F#  D 
To see the places far away

Bm  A  Em  G 
This is his birthday song 
Bm  A  Em  G 
He sings it loud and strong 
Bm  A  Em  G 
He celebrates with joy 
Bm  A Em G 
Jordan is a happy boy 

Bm    G    D    A
Jordan has a lot of friends 
Bm    G    D    A
They share his passion and his lens 
Bm    G    D     A  
They quiz each other on the facts 
Bm     G     D      A  
Like which flag has yellow tracks 

Em     Bm      F#      D  
It's Cyprus, of course, he knows it well 
Em     Bm      F#      D  
It has a map and olive branch as well 
Em     Bm       F#       D  
He likes its history and culture too 
Em     Bm       F#       D  
He wants to visit it with you 

Bm  A  Em  G 
This is his birthday song 
Bm  A  Em  G 
He sings it loud and strong 
Bm  A  Em  G 
He celebrates with joy 
Bm  A Em G (hold)
Jordan is a happy boy 

(bridge)
F#        C#
Jordan has a wish today 
F#        C#
He hopes that it will come true someday (someday) 

(key change to C minor)

Cmi Ab Eb Bb (x2)

Cmi Ab Eb Bb   
He wants to see the world in person   
Cmi Ab Eb Bb   
Not just on maps or screens or books   
Cmi Ab Eb Bb   
He wants to learn from different people   
Cmi Ab Eb Bb   
And taste their food and see their looks   

Gmi Cmi Adim7 Eb    
But until then he'll keep on studying    
Gmi Cmi Adim7 Eb    
And drawing flags with all his might    
Gmi Cmi Adim7 Eb    
And listening to Taylor Swift's music    
Gmi Cmi Adim7 Eb (hold)     
And dreaming of Cyprus every night    

Cmi Bb Gmi Ab     
This is his birthday song     
Cmi Bb Gmi Ab     
He sings it loud and strong     
Cmi Bb Gmi Ab     
He celebrates with joy     
Cmi Bb (hold)      
Jordan is a happy boy     

(end)
