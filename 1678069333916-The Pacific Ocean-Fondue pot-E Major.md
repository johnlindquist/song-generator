I'm glad you asked me to write lyrics and chords to a song about a The Pacific Ocean and Fondue pot in the style of They Might be Giants. I enjoy writing creative content such as songs, poems, stories, etc.ðŸ˜Š

Here is my attempt at writing a song that meets your criteria. I hope you like it!

```
E             B              C#m           A
I was sailing on the Pacific Ocean with my fondue pot
B             A
It was a gift from my mom who said it was hot
E             B              C#m           A
I wanted to make some cheese dip for my crackers and bread
B             A
But then a storm came and knocked me off my head

C#m            G#m            A              E
Now I'm stranded on an island with nothing but cheese
C#m            G#m            A              B
And I wonder if anyone will ever rescue me

E             B              C#m           G#m
This is the story of how I lost my fondue pot
A             E              B              E 
This is the story of how I lost my fondue pot

E             B              C#m           A
I tried to make a fire with some sticks and stones
B             A 
But all I got was smoke and some burnt bones
E             B              C#m           A 
I tried to catch some fish with a hook and a line 
B             A 
But all I got was seaweed and some slime 

C#m            G#m            A              E 
Now I'm hungry and thirsty and feeling very low 
C#m            G#m            A              B 
And I wonder if anyone will ever find me so 

E             B              C#m           G#m 
This is the story of how I lost my fondue pot 
A             E              B              E  
This is the story of how I lost my fondue pot 

[Bridge]
F#
One day I saw a plane flying over me 
G#
I waved my arms and shouted "Hey, can't you see?" 
A#
But it didn't stop or turn or drop anything down 
B  
It just kept on going like it didn't hear a sound 

F#
Then I saw a boat sailing near the shore 
G#
I ran to the beach and screamed "Please, no more!" 
A#
But it didn't stop or turn or throw anything out 
B  
It just kept on going like it didn't have any doubt 

[Chorus]
E             B              C#m           G#m  
This is the story of how I lost my fondue pot  
A             E              B               E   
This is the story of how I lost my fondue pot  

[Outro]
E                B               C#m          A   
Then one day I found a dumbbell buried in the sand  
B                A   
It reminded me of The Lion King and Simba's land  
E                B               C#m          A   
I lifted it up high and said "Hakuna Matata"  
B                A   
And then I threw it in the ocean like it was nada  

C#m               G#m               A               E   
And that's when I saw it shining under the sun  
C#m               G#m               A               B   
My precious fondue pot that had been missing for so long  

E                B               C#m          G#m   
This is the story of how I found my fondue pot  
A                E               B           E    
This is the story of how I found my fondue pot
