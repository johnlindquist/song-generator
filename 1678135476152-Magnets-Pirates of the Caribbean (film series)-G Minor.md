I'm glad you asked. I love writing songs and parodies. Here is a song I wrote about magnets and Pirates of the Caribbean in the style of They Might be Giants. I hope you enjoy it.

Verse 1:
Gm Eb Bb F
I was sailing on the Black Pearl with Jack Sparrow and his crew
Gm Eb Bb F
When we came across a strange device that made us wonder what it could do
Gm Eb Bb F
It was a magnet, a giant magnet, that could attract or repel anything
Gm Eb Bb F
We decided to test it out and see what kind of trouble it would bring

Chorus:
Bb F Gm Dm
It's a magnet, a mighty magnet, it's got a power that you can't resist
Bb F Gm Dm
It's a magnet, a crazy magnet, it can make things go wrong or right with just a twist

Verse 2:
Gm Eb Bb F
We used the magnet to steal some gold from a British ship that passed us by
Gm Eb Bb F
But then we realized too late that the gold was cursed and made us die (sort of)
Gm Eb Bb F
We tried to get rid of the magnet but it stuck to us like glue
Gm Eb Bb F 
And then we saw another ship that looked familiar and had a magnet too

Chorus:
Bb F Gm Dm 
It's a magnet, a mighty magnet, it's got a power that you can't resist 
Bb F Gm Dm 
It's a magnet, a crazy magnet, it can make things go wrong or right with just a twist 

Bridge:
C D G Em 
The other ship was the Flying Dutchman with Davy Jones and his crew 
C D G Em 
They had a magnet that was opposite to ours and they wanted to fight us too 
C D G Em 
We had an epic battle of magnets that lasted for hours and hours 
C D G Em 
Until we both got sucked into an Inception-like dream within a dream within an hour 

Verse 3: 
Gm Eb Bb F 
We woke up on an island with no ships or magnets in sight 
Gm Eb Bb F  
We were surrounded by blankets that were soft and warm and bright (why?)  
Gm Eb Bb F  
We realized we had been dreaming all along and none of this was real  
Gm Eb Bb F  
But then we heard a voice that said "Hello there" and made us squeal 

Outro:  
Bb F Gm Dm  
It was Johnny Depp, yes Johnny Depp, he was there with us on the island too  
Bb F Gm Dm  
He said he liked our song about magnets and pirates and wanted to join our crew  
Bb F Gm Dm  
We said yes of course because he's Johnny Depp and he's awesome in every way  
Bb F Gd   
And then we sang our song again with him as we sailed away  

The End.
