The Yeti and Toothbrush

Verse 1:
D              A
There was a Yeti who lived in the snow
Bm             G
He had no friends and nowhere to go
D              A
He felt so lonely and so very blue
Bm             G
Until he found something shiny and new

Chorus 1:
Em            A           D
It was a toothbrush that someone had dropped
Em            A           D
It was so colorful and it had polka dots
Em            A           D    Bm   Em   A 
It made him happy and it made him smile
G             A           D 
He brushed his teeth every once in a while

Verse 2:
D              A 
He named his toothbrush Timmy Toots
Bm             G 
They played together and they sang some tunes
D              A 
They had adventures in the frozen land
Bm             G 
They were the best of friends, hand in hand

Chorus 2:
Em            A           D 
But then one day a hunter came along
Em            A           D 
He saw the Yeti and he wanted to catch him strong
Em            A           D    Bm   Em   A 
He chased him down with his big old gun
G             A           D 
The Yeti ran away but he left behind his fun

Bridge:
Bm             F#m          G              Em  
Timmy Toots was sad, he missed his furry pal
Bm             F#m          G              Em  
He wished he could see him again somehow

Verse 3:
D              A 
The hunter picked up Timmy Toots from the ground
Bm             G 
He thought it was weird but he liked how it looked around
D              A 
He took it home and he put it on his hat
Bm             G 
He didn't know that it was a toothbrush that

Chorus 3:
Em            A           D 
Could talk to animals with an artificial neural network (what?)
Em            A           D 
That's right, Timmy Toots was a smart toothbrush (wow)
Em            A           D    Bm   Em   A  
He used his skills to call for help from the birds (tweet tweet)
G             A           D  
They flew him back to his friend in the snow (yay)

Outro:
D              A  
The Yeti was so happy to see Timmy Toots again (hooray)
Bm             G  
They hugged each other and they said they're sorry (aww)
D              A  
They vowed to never leave each other's side (forever)
Bm             G  
They lived happily ever after in the snow (the end)

[Repeat chorus 1]
