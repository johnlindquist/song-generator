Okay, I'll try my best to compose a song for you. Here it is:

```markdown
# Tuvalu or Djibouti

Em  A  D  Bm
Jordan was an ordinary boy
Em  A  D  Bm
Living in a boring town
Em  A  D  Bm
He dreamed of seeing the world someday
Em  A  D   Bm
But he didn't know how

G   D   Em   Bm
Then he found a magic tea kettle
G   D   Em   Bm
That could grant him any wish
G   D   Em    Bm 
He wished to visit exotic places 
G    D    Em    Bm 
And he turned into a fish

D    A    Bm    F#
Tuvalu or Djibouti, he didn't care where he went
D    A    Bm    F#
