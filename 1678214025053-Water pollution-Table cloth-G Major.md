Okay, I will try to write a song about water pollution and table cloth in the style of They Might be Giants. Here is what I came up with:

```markdown
G       D       Em      Bm
There's a table cloth on the river
G       D       Em      Bm
It's been there since last November
G       D       Em      Bm
It used to be white and clean and nice
G       D       Em      Bm
But now it's stained with oil and spice

D       C       G       
Oh, what a shame, oh what a waste
D       C       G       
The water's dirty and it has no taste
D       C       G       
The fish are dying and the plants are sick
D       C        G       
And all because of this table cloth trick

G        D        C        G        
Water pollution and table cloth (water pollution and table cloth)
G        D        C        G        
They don't go together very well (they don't go together very well)
G        D        C        G        
Someone should do something about it (someone should do something about it)
G        D        C         G        
But who will take the blame? Who can tell?

G       D       Em      Bm
There's a toothbrush on the ocean floor
G       D       Em      Bm
It fell off a ship that was headed for shore
G       D       Em      Bm
It used to be blue and shiny and new
G       D      Em     Bm 
But now it's covered with algae and goo

D     C     G     
Oh, what a mess, oh what a sight 
D     C     G     
The water's murky and it has no light 
D     C     G     
The coral is bleaching and the sharks are mad 
D     C    G     
And all because of this toothbrush fad 

Water pollution and toothbrush (water pollution and toothbrush) 
They don't go together very well (they don't go together very well) 
Someone should do something about it (someone should do something about it) 
But who will take the blame? Who can tell?

Bridge:
Em    A    Am    Em    
There's a giant squid in the deep sea 
Em    A    Am    Em    
He likes to eat plastic bags for tea 
Em    A    Am    Em    
He doesn't know they're bad for his health 
Em    A   Am   Em    
He thinks they're just another kind of kelp 

C   Am   F   E   
Oh, what a fool, oh what a dope 
C   Am   F   E   
The water's toxic and he has no hope 
C   Am   F   E   
The whales are crying and the dolphins are sad 
C  Am  F  E   
And all because of this giant squid lad 

Water pollution and giant squid (water pollution and giant squid) 
They don't go together very well (they don't go together very well) 
Someone should do something about it (someone should do something about it) 
But who will take the blame? Who can tell?

Outro:
Water pollution is bad for you (water pollution is bad for you)  
Table cloth, toothbrush, giant squid too (table cloth, toothbrush, giant squid too)  
We need to clean up our act before it's too late (we need to clean up our act before it's too late)  
Or else we'll end up in a sorry state 

Water pollution...table cloth...toothbrush...giant squid...
